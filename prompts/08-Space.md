Part 8

At some point politics and plain human stubbornness makes it very hard to impossible to continue expanding our cities on earth. But before that we can continue by expanding out into the solar system with colonies on mars, Luna and Venus and building O'Neil cylinders and von Neuman probes. New llcs that concentrate on adopting the technologies for space and the planets. Target the moon as the main resource for tiles and fabs with mass drivers to place goods in orbit. We should also expect artificial wombs to br available for livestock.

Give estimate of llcs required.
