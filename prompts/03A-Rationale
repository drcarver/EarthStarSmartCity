Prompt 3A Rationale

Given the typical reasons vertical farms fail and regular farms for that matter specify how this system addresses those problems and provides for solutions given an aggressive feasibility analysis for the project. 
what aspects of this system that we're proposing are unique in the sense that nobody else is trying them and why do you suppose that is? Given all the advancements we're proposing here and changes to the current 
agricultural system it still seems to have a very high viability without much mitigation then would include creating tiles from waste is that about accurate.

Assume we're going to research into automated womb technology so that we can provide for more ethical raising of farm animals.  Use aquaponics to supply any wild caught fish or anything so that we can reduce the
amount of fishing done for overfishing.  How does ths effect the project viability?

Create any new kits as needed. Recompute costs and revenues as needed. Implement any suggestions to increase viability. Reuse any existing kits and tiles as needed. All tiles and kits required are received from the tile factory. All buildings are construed using tiles, ceramics and kits only. Provide for smart airlocks in all buildings that scan for weapons and explosives and alert security. Implement all smart city standards required including security. Support sustainable building codes.

Apply any Suggestions to Enhance Viability and reduce bottlenecks
