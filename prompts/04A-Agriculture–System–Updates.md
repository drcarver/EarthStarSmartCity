# Prompt – Genesis Network: Agriculture System Updates & Enhancements

## Objective

Evolve the existing agriculture capabilities (aquaponics pods, staples pods, agroforestry kits, microbial inoculants) into a fully precision-enabled, resilient, high-yield, and revenue-diversified subsystem. Introduce new/updated tiles, pods, and kits to achieve:

- 15–45% yield increases  
- 20–50% input reductions (water, fertilizer, pesticides)  
- Enhanced pollination reliability and biodiversity credits  
- Soil/root health optimization and long-term sequestration  
- Post-harvest value-add for premium processed goods  
- Vertical/urban density integration in towers/cities  

All additions must:
- Be manufactured in existing Tile & Pipe Production Pods → Tile Factories (70–95% waste-derived toughened ceramics)  
- Integrate natively with RTK GPS Tiles, dense sensor nets, digital twins, microbial inoculant pods, and staggered cycles  
- Support retail/affiliate sales (high-margin external channels)  
- Be mobile-capable for smallholder deployment  
- Maximize nutrient, water, carbon, and biodiversity loops  

## Required New & Enhanced Components

### New/Enhanced Tiles

1. Soil Moisture & Nutrient Tile  
2. Canopy Microclimate Tile  
3. Pollination & Bee Activity Tile  
4. Pest & Disease Early Detection Tile  
5. Root Zone Imaging Tile  

### New/Enhanced Pods

1. Precision Ag Control Pod  
2. Beehive Monitoring & Support Pod  
3. Post-Harvest Processing Pod  
4. Soil Remediation & Biochar Pod  
5. Vertical Farming Tower Pod  

### New/Enhanced Kits

1. Precision Ag Starter Kit  
2. Beehive Integration Kit  
3. Post-Harvest Mini-Processing Kit  
4. Biochar & Soil Amendment Kit  
5. Vertical Ag Expansion Kit  

## Guidelines for Specification

For each tile/pod/kit, include:
- Primary function  
- Key features / embedded tech  
- Main input sources  
- Material composition  
- Est. production cost & selling price  
- Project phase (Phase 2: 2031–2035 preferred)  
- Revenue potential (internal + retail/affiliate)  
- Integration notes (RTK, sensors, twins, etc.)  

## Viability & Financial Targets

- Yield/input gains: 15–45% / 20–50%  
- New revenue streams: precision credits, premium processed goods, affiliate kit sales  
- Network-wide incremental revenue (mature): $8–$86B/year  
- Payback: 6–24 months per component  
- IRR uplift: +11–26%  

Output in structured tables with viability/integration notes at the end.
