# Earth-Star Smart City Complex – MHUE-50k (Validated Master Specification – November 2025)

**Project start date (first commercial node):** 2 January 2035  
All timelines calculated from this locked date.  
All technology limited to what is already commercially proven or in paid pilot at scale in November 2025.

## Core Mission
Construct and operate a nationwide network of hybrid smart city complexes built exclusively with ceramic tiles and flat-pack kits manufactured by the Genesis Facility (Prompt 1).  
Each MHUE-50k node shall:
- House and sustain 50,000 residents with integrated housing, education, healthcare, industry, and entertainment
- Integrate Skyscraper Farms (Prompt 2) to feed residents with full USDA MyPlate dietary diversity (including culturally/religiously certified options)
- Achieve net exporter status for renewable electricity, water (humid climates), and verified carbon credits
- Generate high-margin revenue from AI data centers, battery manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and tourism
- Enable progressive rewilding of adjacent lands through efficient urban design
- Co-locae with existing genesis factory, terrafab ans farm

## Mandatory Technical Constraints (validated November 2025)

1. **Ceramic tiles are 100 % non-structural** – function exactly like glass curtain wall, terra-cotta rainscreen, or porcelain panels. All gravity, wind, seismic, and blast loads carried by conventional steel or concrete frame/floor system.
2. Primary structure uses scrap-derived steel and recycled-concrete wherever possible, but remains fully code-compliant with standard engineering practice.
3. All processes and buildings use commercially proven 2025 technology (e.g., existing recycling plants, tile factories, CEA systems).
4. Ceramic composition: 92–97 % recycled glass, demolition porcelain, fly ash, etc. + minor binders.
5. Integrated tile functions (2025 limits): CIGS BIPV, embedded copper mesh EMP shielding, AWG micro-channels, IoT sensors, thin supercapacitor (≤ 1 kWh/panel).
6. Energy: On-site biogas from waste + grid + solar; standard combined-cycle engines (no exotic cycles).
7. Water: 98 % closed-loop + AWG + rainwater; net exporter in humid climates.
8. Waste: AI sorting, pyrolysis, vitrification → zero landfill.
9. Skyscraper Farm integration:
   - Vertical towers (150 m tall, 15 floors, 265,000 m² CEA each) for leafy greens, herbs, strawberries, mushrooms, aquaponics (shrimp, tilapia, barramundi to replace wild-catch and reduce overfishing), cultured meat bioreactors, automated processing, ISO 5–8 cleanrooms for vitamins/nutraceuticals.
   - Contiguous horizontal 2,065 ha regenerative component for calorie-dense crops, orchards, nuts, grains, large livestock (cattle, pigs, sheep, goats with rotational grazing and virtual fencing), poultry.
   - R&D allocation for automated artificial womb technology (post-2042 optional) for ethical animal raising.
10. Security: Smart airlocks with facial recognition + hyperspectral threat detection (weapons/explosives) on all high-value entrances.
11. The whole city is DC as much as possible.  We will supply a DC only version of Home Appliances and Home Electronics including a full computer line.
12. Provide for a line of electric barges to haul garbage and other shipping.
13. spokes handle all heavy trafiic.  All other roads are true smart roads built with out foundation and regular tiles to harves rain and provide water and electricity.
14. Standards: LEED Platinum, WELL, Fitwel, BREEAM Outstanding, ISO 37122, local codes, NASA CELSS-derived monitoring.
15. Terrabots can act as roving security with telepresnce when needed with some telepresence from human oversite
16. All city services are paid from city profits as needed.  Most of the city services are monitored and controlled by a central AI that can monitor the city throgh its sensor net.
17. Each city has a elected council and any matter can be brought up for a full electronic vote by  the citiens of the city.
18. Cities also will do Atmospheric carbon remediation and remediate all the swamps, rivers, lakes and oceans while replacing fish from overfisihig. Plantig coral and algae as needed while removing plastics

## Campus Functions (all built with hybrid system)

- Residential: Luxury homes and apartments.  For goverment purpose they can all beconsidred low income housing, although with the modular nature of the buildings they are as luurios as needed.
- Most services are free to residents.  We can use these features as well as the founders zone to attract young professionals
- Skyscraper Farms: 2 vertical + horizontal regenerative
- Healthcare: Level I trauma hospital
- Education: K-12 + college campus
- Commercial: Shopping mall, entertainment, hotels.  Non city supplied items can be bought as normal with terrabots providing security
- Industrial: LFP/Na-ion battery factory, 150 MW AI data center along with a terrafab.
- Supporting: Government, religious, amenities
