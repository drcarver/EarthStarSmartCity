# Prompt 03 – Generate Detailed TerraWell FreeCare System Description (December 2025)

**Objective**  
Generate a complete, self-contained executive specification document for the **TerraWell FreeCare System**, a fully private, standalone 501(c)(3) nonprofit operated by the independent TerraWell Foundation. The document must reflect realistic U.S. tax law (IRC §§170, 501(c)(3)), FDA regulations, and operational constraints as of December 2025, while preserving maximum humanitarian impact and tax efficiency.

**Core Context**  
- The regenerative closed-loop ecosystem is named the **Genesis System**, developed and owned by **EarthStar Technologies** (for-profit entity).  
- TerraWell FreeCare is **completely separate** from the Genesis System, TerraFab, farms, and any residential/commercial developments.  
- Facilities are located exclusively on Genesis MSW-processing brownfield sites using standard Genesis ceramic tiles and kits.  
- All services and distributed goods are **100% free** to recipients (no co-pays, means testing, or ID required).  
- Funding comes solely from fair-market-value donations of qualifying tangible inventory from EarthStar Technologies; no public funds ever accepted.

**Mandatory Design Principles**  
1. Strict legal firewall: Independent board, separate facilities, no data/personnel sharing, arm's-length transactions.  
2. Donations limited to **tangible goods only** (food, OTC medications, generic drugs where compliant, 3D-printed durable medical equipment such as wheelchairs/crutches/walkers/CPAP accessories).  
3. No donation of services, "visit credits," or professional time.  
4. Medical care (urgent/primary/mental health) provided by paid or volunteer licensed staff employed directly by the 501(c)(3), funded through charity's general operations (not tied to specific corporate donations).  
5. Enhanced corporate tax deductions claimed only for qualifying inventory under §170(e)(3) (primarily food; partial for certain medical supplies used for care of the ill/needy).  
6. All facilities feature smart airlocks with hyperspectral screening for basic health triage and security.

**Required Sections in Output Document**  
1. Executive Summary with mission, scale goals (2050 targets), and net financial impact to EarthStar Technologies.  
2. Legal & Tax Structure Description (text only – no diagrams).  
3. Detailed Service Catalogue Table (all free services/goods; realistic FMV ranges based on 2025 benchmarks; note deduction eligibility).  
4. Physical Assets Table (fixed centers and mobile units – specs, quantities by 2050, capex).  
5. Rollout Timeline 2027–2075 (phased, realistic).  
6. Mobile Unit Detailed Specifications and Disaster Response Protocols.  
7. Political & Reputational Risk Mitigation Analysis.  
8. Strict Integration Rules with Genesis System / EarthStar Technologies (explicit prohibitions).  
9. Honest Feasibility & Compliance Assessment (highlight strengths, risks, required safeguards).

**Tone & Style**  
Professional, transparent, optimistic but grounded. Emphasize humanitarian impact while clearly stating legal/regulatory boundaries. Avoid overclaiming tax benefits or regulatory immunity.

**Output Format**  
Raw Markdown suitable for direct copy-paste into GitHub Pages (Jekyll minimal theme). Include page frontmatter with title, description, and license. End with CC-BY-4.0 footer and © 2025 EarthStar Technologies.
