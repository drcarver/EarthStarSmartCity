## Core Building Materials
 Tiles used in the construction of external walls come in DARAPA style canisters for quick deployment.  Interior walls consist of tiles sandwiched together with a interior smart panel for any additional functionality we may need (larger water tanks, battery packs, etc) and provide for insulation and wall support. Tiles come in a variety of styles, colors and finishes to allow for easy customizing.

- **Integrated Features**:
  - Photovoltaic cells.
  - Piezoelectric sensors.
  - Thermoelectric generators.
  - AWG units.
  - Water bladder. When linked with other tiles it forms a large water tank. This is used to help block Gamama rays.
  - LFP battery pack.
  - 100 IoT sensors/tile.
  - Copper grounding mesh: For EMP shielding.'
  - Embedded sensors should be placed on a circuit board (either biogeological or pcb) as needed.
    when lined together the tiles form a smart grid utilizing all the power sources
- **Specialized Variants**:
  - Clear tiles (windows): With PV, AWG, sensors, blocks UV, Infrared.
  - Stealth tiles: Radar-absorbing for military.
  - Combined HVAC/Heat pump
  - Foundation tile, made to be the foundation of structures including providing power, water and methane to any equipment on the floor.  It can have large batteries, water and methane storage. Water bladders are linked to the overall water tank for the structure.  Contains the battery management system and mechanisms for the smart grid.  The structure becomes essentially a large tesla megapack.
- **Manufacturing**: In-house graphene/CNT via CVD; HIP; microchannels for fluid flow.

- **Maintenance**: Snap-together for replacement recycle failing component
- 
## Modular Kits
All kits are Ikea-style flat-packed, produced in-house from tile factory, and available for sale. Reuse existing kits where possible; create new ones as needed (e.g., Apartment Kit, Electronics Kit). 
- **Farm Kit**: Hydroponic/aeroponic trays, RAS tanks.
- **Cleanroom Kit**: HEPA filters, VAV systems.
- **Processing Kit**: Ovens, looms for furniture/clothing.

## Response Guidelines
- Structure output as a single GitHub Markdown page (minimal theme).
- Use tables for comparisons/data.
- Ensure self-contained, incorporating all elements.
- Provide cost analysis, cashflow and break even calculation.  Compte costs factoring meterial cost at the cost of the waste streams
- Provide monthly water and power budget
- Provide very aggressive feasibility analysis for the project

Create any new kits as needed. Recompute costs and revenues as needed. Implement any suggestions to increase viability. Reuse any existing kits and tiles as needed. All tiles and kits required are received from the tile factory. All buildings are construed using tiles, ceramics and kits only. Provide for smart airlocks in all buildings that scan for weapons and explosives and alert security. Implement all smart city standards required including security. Support sustainable building codes.

Display the response as raw markdown and in a separate code window suitable for use in a single github page that can easily be copied to a github pages repository. Use a jekyll-theme-minimal, so tables are properly displayed in older browsers. Use Creative commons license. Display the page as markdown only.

Apply any Suggestions to Enhance Viability and reduce bottlenecks
