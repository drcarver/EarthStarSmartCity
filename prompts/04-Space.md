# Space Expansion Full Plan with Starship V3

## Overview

After the U.S. Genesis Network is fully proven, Earth-Star Industries will accelerate space expansion, leveraging SpaceX Starship v3 as the **primary transport vehicle to Luna**, Mars, Venus, O’Neill cylinders, and orbital platforms. Space LLCs provide:  

- **Resources** (tiles, rare gases, regolith, water, biomass)  
- **R&D feedback** to Earth hubs (resilience, efficiency, closed-loop design)  
- **Revenue streams** to accelerate self-funding  

Transport to Luna uses Starship v3 (payload ~100 metric tons to LEO, ~100 tons to TLI/Lunar orbit), enabling rapid kit deployment, mass driver integration, and closed-loop test habitats.
