## Objective

Define the complete specification for a **personal Communicator Badge** in the Genesis Network — optimized for general users rather than professional first responders — while retaining advanced features for **safety, health, connectivity, and situational awareness**.

The enhanced badge provides:

- **Personal health monitoring**: vitals, stress, hydration, activity tracking.  
- **Environmental awareness**: air quality, temperature extremes, noise, radiation.  
- **Universal translation**: real-time spoken and written translation (e.g., Spanish → English, default language setting).  
- **Integration with drones and VR/HUD**: remote viewing, night/thermal vision, and augmented reality overlays.  
- **Networked alert and communication system**: emergency notifications, personal reminders, and peer-to-peer messaging.

## Core Design Principles

- **Form factor:** Lightweight wearable (clip-on or lanyard) with ruggedized ceramic/polymer shell, IP67.  
- **Power:** Sodium-ion battery, piezo-harvesting, inductive charging (home, car docks).  
- **Processing:** Local RISC-V compute with AI-assisted interpretation and privacy-first processing.  
- **Connectivity:** Encrypted BLE/mmWave mesh for badges, tiles, drones, and devices.  
- **Modularity:** Optional snap-in modules (advanced sensors, drone controllers, AR/VR interfaces).  
- **User Focus:** Simple, intuitive interface suitable for civilians, students, commuters, and travelers.
