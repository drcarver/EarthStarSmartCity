## Overview

The **enhanced First Responder tricorder** is a handheld, multi-sensor diagnostic and situational awareness device that integrates with:

- **Communicator Badge** for alerts, translation, and digital twin sync  
- **Responder Patch** for continuous vitals monitoring  
- **Drone Swarm** for extended situational awareness  
- **HUD/VR Systems** for immersive decision support  

It provides real-time translation, environmental and chemical hazard detection, trauma assessment, and full situational awareness for first responders.

## Drone Swarm Integration

- Modes: Scout, Follow/Support, Relay/Comms, Payload Delivery  
- Sensors: Thermal, IR, low-light, chemical/CBRN  
- Data streamed to tricorder/badge → AR/VR HUD overlays  
- Benefits: “See through walls,” map incident zones, track moving targets, monitor hazards, coordinate team safety

## First Responder Benefits

1. Enhanced awareness via drone + tricorder fusion  
2. Immediate threat detection (weapons, chemicals, environmental risks)  
3. Health & safety monitoring with patch integration  
4. Real-time language translation  
5. Evidence & accountability with geo-tagged recording  
6. Decision support via AR/VR overlays
