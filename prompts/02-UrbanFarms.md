# Prompt 2 – Earth-Star Skyscraper Farm

**Project start date (first commercial node):** 2 January 2032  
All timelines and specifications are calculated from this fixed date.  
All technology is 100 % manufactured and installed by Earth-Star Industries using Genesis-1/2/3 kits and TerraBot/TerraCrop™ swarms.

## Core Mission
Construct and operate a nationwide network of fully robotic, zero-labor, net-energy-and-water-positive Skyscraper Farms built exclusively from flat-pack kits produced by the Genesis Facility.  
Each mature node shall:

- Feed **11,200 people** year-round with full USDA MyPlate dietary diversity (including meat, dairy, eggs, grains, fruits, nuts, vegetables, and cultural/religious options)
- Produce **≥70 M USD** annual free cash flow after all costs
- Be **100 % net exporter** of renewable electricity and potable water in all U.S. climates
- Generate additional high-margin revenue from greenhouse sales, software subscriptions, and verified carbon credits
- Enable progressive rewilding of **≥2 million acres** of existing U.S. farmland by 2050
- Replicate at **one new node every 18–24 months** after 2042 using greenhouse sales profits

## Mandatory Technical Constraints (All 100 % In-House)

1. **All greenhouse glazing** = ETFE + TerraSun™ thin-film CIGS solar + FogCapture™ AWG + rear capillary thermal mat – manufactured at Genesis factories  
2. **All robots** = TerraCrop™ swarm (transplanting, de-leafing, harvesting, scouting, pollination) – 100 % designed and built by Earth-Star  
3. **All construction** = 100 % TerraBot + TerraCrop™ swarm (4–4.5 months per 100 ha)  
4. **Zero permanent human presence** inside any growing area after initial transplant  
5. **All energy systems** = geothermal primary loop + roof solar + biogas backup  
6. **All water systems** = 100 % closed loop + roof AWG – net exporter in every U.S. climate  
7. **All buildings** = Genesis ceramic rainscreen (non-structural) on steel primary structure  
8. **All products** shipped as sequenced flat-pack “PEZ/IKEA-style” dispenser kits for robotic assembly

## Locked Commercial Strategy (Mandatory from 2038)

- Minimum **85 %** of annual ModuGreenhouse-01 production is sold externally at full margin  
- Turnkey price: **$820–$920 per m²** installed (100 ha minimum)  
- 5-year service + software subscription mandatory  
- Expected external sales profit 2038–2060: **$42–$58 billion**

## Locked Realism Corrections – Final Integrated Block (December 2025)

1. People fed per node: **11,200** (all higher figures permanently deleted)  
2. Greenhouse area per node: **420 hectares** (280 ha and lower permanently deleted)  
3. All glazing, robots, steel, HVAC, geothermal, LEDs, ceramics, sensors, AI: **100 % manufactured in-house**  
4. Construction method: **100 % TerraBot/TerraCrop™ swarm** – zero human labor inside crop zones  
5. Active capillary thermal/snow-melt layer: **mandatory** on every glazing panel  
6. Commercial sales of ModuGreenhouse-01: **mandatory** at ≥85 % of capacity starting 2038
