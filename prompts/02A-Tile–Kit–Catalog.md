# Prompt 02A – Tile & Kit Catalog (Phase 1–2 Foundation)

## 1. Objective & Scope

Provide a **minimal, high-ROI catalog** of tiles and kits needed to bootstrap hubs, build basic structures, generate early revenue, and enable affiliate scaling — limited to **12 tiles** and **10 kits** to eliminate complexity and accelerate production.

All items are:
- Manufactured in **Tile & Pipe Production Pods** → permanent Tile Factories  
- 70–95% waste-derived (C&D slag priority, rice husk ash silica, farm residues, brownfield/ELFM slag)  
- Snap-together with blind-mate interconnects (power/data/thermal/water)  
- Designed for lights-out automation (50–75% Day 1 → 85–95% mature)  
- Revenue-positive within months via internal use + external/affiliate sales  

This catalog replaces the sprawling 40–50+ item lists in previous prompts (e.g., original 02A–02I tile variants, compute/network tiles, HIL components, retail signage, etc.).

## 2. Replaced Prompts

This single prompt fully replaces / absorbs:

- Original Prompt 02A (Market-Ready Tiles, AI Upgrades, Rapid Factory Staging)  
- Original Prompt 02B (Compute & Network Tiles with Independent Storage)  
- Parts of Prompt 02I (Human Interface Layer – RTK tiles, basic WiFi tiles)  
- Parts of Prompt 02G (Non-Agricultural Enhancements – energy storage, security, airlock tiles)  
- Parts of Prompt 04A (Hybrid Tile + 3D-Printed Construction – tile-dominant focus)  
- Scattered tile references across other prompts (roof glazing, cladding, road, etc.)

Deferred / removed from active Phase 1–2: smart display walls, full compute tiles, clothing clones, advanced networking waveguides, retail signage tiles, most processing pod variants.

## 5. Manufacturing & Financial Notes (Recalculated)

- **Production**: All tiles/kits from same factories; CAPEX $80–180M/hub mature (down 20–30% from prior sprawl).  
- **Revenue Model**:  
  - Internal hub use: 40–50%  
  - Affiliate/mini-hub sales: 30–40%  
  - External/retail contracts: 10–20%  
- **Mature Hub Revenue (tiles/kits only)**: $150–450M/year (up 20% from simpler production).  
- **Payback**: 4–9 months per factory cluster.
