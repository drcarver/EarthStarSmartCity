## 1. Objective & Scope

Provide a **fully modular, simulation-aware foundation** for Genesis hubs including:

- **Tiles & Kits**: Revenue-positive, snap-together, regenerative materials, digital twin parameters  
- **Human Interface Layer (HIL)**: Modular Prism-based HIL including RTK, environmental, ag, bio, and security sensors  
- **Prism Modules**: Partial-class codegen ready for multiple sensor types with auto-test stubs, SUC manifests, and CI/CD-ready registration  
- **Digital Twin Integration**: Simulated hub & tile performance for energy, water, yield, and resiliency  
- **SUC Lifecycle Management**: Atomic, signed, rollback-capable service updates for all modules  

This prompt **replaces** previous 02A, 02B, and partial 02C specifications, integrating codegen, simulation, and deployment considerations.

**Request:** Recompute all financials, hub replication timelines, and revenue forecasts using digital twin simulations and updated module costs.
