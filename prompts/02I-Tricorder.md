## Overview

The **consumer tricorder** combines health, safety, environmental awareness, real-time translation, and immersive situational intelligence:

- Health monitoring: vitals, ECG, SpO₂, BP, temperature
- Environmental sensing: air quality, radiation, noise, temperature
- Universal translator: real-time translation with user-defined default language
- Drone swarm integration: thermal, IR, chemical, and visual feeds
- VR/HUD display: immersive 3D situational overlays
- Patch integration: continuous vitals + alert notifications
