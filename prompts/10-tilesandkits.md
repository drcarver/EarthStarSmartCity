## Objective & Design Principles

This document consolidates all **tiles**, **pods**, and **kits** in the Genesis Network. All are manufactured exclusively in **[Tile & Pipe Production Pods](components/pods/tile-pipe-production-pod.md)** → permanent tile factories using 70–95% waste-derived toughened ceramics. All structures are built solely from tiles, ceramics, and kits — no conventional concrete, steel, or other materials except where minimal for structural necessity (e.g., RCA bases under tile cladding).

**All-Electric Update (Implemented)**: Primary energy is now 100% electric via **[Battery & Storage LLC](innovation-hub/battery-storage-llc.md)** sodium-ion tiles, **[Sustainable Energy LLC](innovation-hub/sustainable-energy-llc.md)** BIPV/piezo generation, and inductive charging in roads. Hydrogen is completely removed from all components. Biogas methane remains only as a backup fuel source (via **[Biogas Digester Pod](components/pods/biogas-digester-pod.md)**) for extended isolation or peak demand.

**Smart Airlocks**: Mandatory in **all buildings** (mmWave/hyperspectral + trace detectors for weapons/explosives/narcotics; silent alerts to security via **[Dense Sensor Net Kit](components/kits/dense-sensor-net-kit.md)**).

**Standards Compliance**: All designs align with smart city standards (**[ISO/TC 268](docs/standards/iso-tc-268-smart-cities.md)**, IEEE 2030, ITU-T Y.4900, Matter/Thread) and sustainable building codes (**[ISO 14001](docs/standards/iso-14001-environmental.md)**, Cradle-to-Cradle).
