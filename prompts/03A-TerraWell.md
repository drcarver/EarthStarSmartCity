# Prompt 03A – TerraWell FreeCare System  
**“Everything Free, Everything Deductible” – Validated Master Specification (November 2025)**

**Locked first FreeCare centers & mobile units:** Q1 2035  
All timelines, costs, and legal structures calculated from this date using only 2025-validated technology and IRS Section 170 rules.

## Core Mission
Create a nationwide (later global) network of **100 % free** health & food centers and mobile units that:
- Supplies food banks with packaging branded for the food bank
- Give away all services and products at zero charge to the public
- Operate as a genuine 501(c)(3) nonprofit (TerraWell Foundation) funded entirely by fair-market-value donations from Earth-Star Industries (for-profit)
- Generate massive tax deductions that effectively make the entire program free or cash-positive to Earth-Star after tax savings
- Build unbreakable grassroots political protection for the entire Earth-Star ecosystem
- Remain completely separate from farms, TerraFabs, Genesis factories, and MHUE cities (located only on MSW-processing brownfields)

## Mandatory Constraints (locked – no exceptions)
1. **Zero cost to recipients** – no co-pays, no means testing, no government IDs required
2. **100 % private funding** – no Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, or public dollars ever accepted
3. **All donations at FMV** – Earth-Star donates food, generics, devices, clinic time, mobile units at full retail value to the 501(c)(3)
4. **Complete legal firewall** – TerraWell Foundation has independent board, separate facilities, no data sharing with for-profit side
5. **Physical separation** – facilities built only on Genesis MSW sites, never inside farms, fabs, or cities

## Financial Model (Aggressive Roll-Out)

| Year | People Served Free | Annual FMV Donated | Tax Savings (30 % blended) | Net Cost to Earth-Star | EBITDA Contribution |
|------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| 2035 | 2 million          | $2.8 B             | $840 M                     | $420 M                  | +$420 M             |
| 2040 | 25 million         | $38 B              | $11.4 B                    | $5.7 B                  | +$5.7 B             |
| 2050 | 120 million        | $192 B             | $57.6 B                    | $28.8 B                 | +$28.8 B            |
| 2075 | 400 million        | $680 B             | $204 B                     | $102 B                  | +$102 B             |

**Net result**: After ~2042 the program becomes cash-flow positive to Earth-Star due to tax shield exceeding actual costs.

## REALISM CORRECTION ADDENDUM – TERRAWELL FREECARE (30 NOVEMBER 2025)  
**(Locked – Supersedes Every Conflicting Statement Above)**

The following conservative, IRS-compliant constraints replace all earlier optimistic or legally impossible claims. These are the only numbers TerraWell Foundation and Earth-Star Industries will ever represent to the IRS, state attorneys general, or the public.

1. **Deductible Donations Limited to Tangible Property Only**  
   - No deduction for donated services (physician time, therapy sessions, clinic operating months).  
   - Only food, generic drugs, OTC medicines, and 3D-printed durable medical equipment qualify.

2. **Enhanced Inventory Deduction (IRC §170(e)(3)) Applies**  
   - Maximum deduction = cost of goods + 50 % of appreciation (FMV − cost).  
   - Absolute cap = 2 × cost of goods.  
   - Example: food costing Earth-Star $25/basket with $110 FMV → maximum deduction = $67.50/basket, not $110.

3. **Revised Tax Savings Rate**  
   - Blended federal + state rate: 26.5 %.  
   - §170 limitation: 10 % of taxable income annually with 5-year carryforward.

4. **Corrected Financial Model (2035–2075, IRS-Compliant)**

| Year | People Served | Tangible Goods Donated (at cost) | Max Deduction Allowed | Tax Savings @ 26.5 % | Net After-Tax Cost to Earth-Star |
|------|----------------|---------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 2035 | 2 million      | $4.2 B                         | $8.4 B              | $2.23 B                | $1.97 B                         |
| 2040 | 25 million     | $52 B                          | $104 B               | $27.6 B               | $24.4 B                         |
| 2050 | 120 million    | $250 B                         | $500 B               | $132.5 B              | $117.5 B                        |
| 2075 | 400 million    | $830 B                         | $1.66 T             | $440 B                | $390 B                          |

5. **Program Remains Net Cost (Never Cash-Positive)**  
   The program will always have a positive net after-tax cost of approximately 45–50 % of actual production cost. It is a genuine philanthropic activity, not a profit center.

6. **Governance Fixes**  
   - TerraWell Foundation board: ≤33 % Earth-Star-affiliated directors.  
   - Independent compensation and valuation committees required.  
   - Annual independent audit and Form 990-PF-level disclosure if private-foundation rules are triggered.

These corrected figures are the sole figures that will appear in any IRS filing, grant application, or public statement.
