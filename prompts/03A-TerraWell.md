# Prompt 03A – TerraWell FreeCare System  
**“Everything Free, Everything Deductible” – Validated Master Specification (November 2025)**

**Locked first FreeCare centers & mobile units:** Q1 2035  
All timelines, costs, and legal structures calculated from this date using only 2025-validated technology and IRS Section 170 rules.

## Core Mission
Create a nationwide (later global) network of **100 % free** health & food centers and mobile units that:
- Supplies food banks with packaging branded for the food bank
- Give away all services and products at zero charge to the public
- Operate as a genuine 501(c)(3) nonprofit (TerraWell Foundation) funded entirely by fair-market-value donations from Earth-Star Industries (for-profit)
- Generate massive tax deductions that effectively make the entire program free or cash-positive to Earth-Star after tax savings
- Build unbreakable grassroots political protection for the entire Earth-Star ecosystem
- Remain completely separate from farms, TerraFabs, Genesis factories, and MHUE cities (located only on MSW-processing brownfields)

## Mandatory Constraints (locked – no exceptions)
1. **Zero cost to recipients** – no co-pays, no means testing, no government IDs required
2. **100 % private funding** – no Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, or public dollars ever accepted
3. **All donations at FMV** – Earth-Star donates food, generics, devices, clinic time, mobile units at full retail value to the 501(c)(3)
4. **Complete legal firewall** – TerraWell Foundation has independent board, separate facilities, no data sharing with for-profit side
5. **Physical separation** – facilities built only on Genesis MSW sites, never inside farms, fabs, or cities

## Financial Model (Aggressive Roll-Out)

| Year | People Served Free | Annual FMV Donated | Tax Savings (30 % blended) | Net Cost to Earth-Star | EBITDA Contribution |
|------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| 2035 | 2 million          | $2.8 B             | $840 M                     | $420 M                  | +$420 M             |
| 2040 | 25 million         | $38 B              | $11.4 B                    | $5.7 B                  | +$5.7 B             |
| 2050 | 120 million        | $192 B             | $57.6 B                    | $28.8 B                 | +$28.8 B            |
| 2075 | 400 million        | $680 B             | $204 B                     | $102 B                  | +$102 B             |

**Net result**: After ~2042 the program becomes cash-flow positive to Earth-Star due to tax shield exceeding actual costs.

## REALISM CORRECTION ADDENDUM – TERRAWELL FREECARE (30 NOVEMBER 2025)  
**(Locked – Supersedes Every Conflicting Statement Above)**

The following conservative, IRS-compliant constraints replace all earlier optimistic or legally impossible claims. These are the only numbers TerraWell Foundation and Earth-Star Industries will ever represent to the IRS, state attorneys general, or the public.

1. **Deductible Donations Limited to Tangible Property Only**  
   - No deduction for donated services (physician time, therapy sessions, clinic operating months).  
   - Only food, generic drugs, OTC medicines, and 3D-printed durable medical equipment qualify.

2. **Enhanced Inventory Deduction (IRC §170(e)(3)) Applies**  
   - Maximum deduction = cost of goods + 50 % of appreciation (FMV − cost).  
   - Absolute cap = 2 × cost of goods.  
   - Example: food costing Earth-Star $25/basket with $110 FMV → maximum deduction = $67.50/basket, not $110.

3. **Revised Tax Savings Rate**  
   - Blended federal + state rate: 26.5 %.  
   - §170 limitation: 10 % of taxable income annually with 5-year carryforward.

4. **Corrected Financial Model (2035–2075, IRS-Compliant)**

| Year | People Served | Tangible Goods Donated (at cost) | Max Deduction Allowed | Tax Savings @ 26.5 % | Net After-Tax Cost to Earth-Star |
|------|----------------|---------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 2035 | 2 million      | $4.2 B                         | $8.4 B              | $2.23 B                | $1.97 B                         |
| 2040 | 25 million     | $52 B                          | $104 B               | $27.6 B               | $24.4 B                         |
| 2050 | 120 million    | $250 B                         | $500 B               | $132.5 B              | $117.5 B                        |
| 2075 | 400 million    | $830 B                         | $1.66 T             | $440 B                | $390 B                          |

5. **Program Remains Net Cost (Never Cash-Positive)**  
   The program will always have a positive net after-tax cost of approximately 45–50 % of actual production cost. It is a genuine philanthropic activity, not a profit center.

6. **Governance Fixes**  
   - TerraWell Foundation board: ≤33 % Earth-Star-affiliated directors.  
   - Independent compensation and valuation committees required.  
   - Annual independent audit and Form 990-PF-level disclosure if private-foundation rules are triggered.

These corrected figures are the sole figures that will appear in any IRS filing, grant application, or public statement.

## Identified Remaining Critical Discrepancies

| # | Claim (Original or Nov 2025 Addendum)                                 | Contradiction / 2025–2035 Legal or Operational Reality                                                                                  | Severity  |
|---|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | “Zero cost to recipients – no co-pays, no means testing, no government IDs required” | Providing unlimited free physician visits, psychiatry, and scheduled-drug dispensing without any ID or eligibility check violates federal and state fraud/abuse laws, DEA regulations, and medical-board rules. Free clinics must document identity and medical necessity. | Critical  |
| 2 | Mental health therapy includes “ketamine/psilocybin (when legal)”     | Ketamine and psilocybin are Schedule I/III (ketamine) or Schedule I (psilocybin) at federal level. A 501(c)(3) cannot dispense Schedule I substances outside FDA-approved trials, and ketamine clinics require DEA registration and strict patient tracking. | Critical  |
| 3 | “Primary care annual unlimited” + “urgent care visit” at zero charge | Unlimited free physician services triggers IRS private-benefit doctrine and state corporate-practice-of-medicine prohibitions if physicians are employed directly by the nonprofit without fair-market compensation controls. | Critical  |
| 4 | Mobile units valued at “$1.6 M/month” for deduction                    | IRS only allows deduction for tangible property donated, not for the value of services rendered by a mobile clinic. The trailer itself is deductible once; operating months are not. | Critical  |
| 5 | All facilities use “smart airlocks with hyperspectral screening”     | Hyperspectral threat-detection airlocks are ITAR/EAR-controlled and cannot be installed in a civilian humanitarian clinic without BIS export-license violations. | Critical  |
| 6 | “No government IDs required”                                          | Federal law (42 CFR § 431.307) and most state laws require identity verification for any entity dispensing controlled substances (even Schedule V). Complete anonymity is impossible for a legitimate pharmacy. | Critical  |
| 7 | 3D-printing of FDA-regulated durable medical equipment on-site       | Custom 3D-printed Class II devices (wheelchairs, CPAP masks, splints) require 510(k) clearance or de novo authorization per device design. A free clinic cannot legally print and distribute uncleared devices at scale. | Critical  |
| 8 | Projected scale to 120–400 million people served                      | U.S. population 2075 projected ~420 million. Even the largest charity (Feeding America) currently reaches ~60 million/year. 120+ million exceeds total food-insecure + uninsured population by 3–5×. | Major     |

## Locked Realism Corrections – Version 3.0 (Binding Forever – 1 December 2025)

These supersede every prior statement in Prompt 03A and the 30 November 2025 Addendum:

1. **Patient identification** → All recipients must present government-issued photo ID and undergo standard medical intake. No anonymous service for controlled substances or physician visits (DEA & medical-board requirement).  
2. **Scheduled drugs** → Only Schedule V and below dispensed without physician visit; ketamine and psilocybin permanently deleted from service catalogue.  
3. **Physician services** → Provided via contracted independent 1099 physicians or partner FQHCs at fair-market rates; no direct employment by the 501(c)(3) to avoid CPOM issues.  
4. **Deduction scope** → Limited exclusively to tangible goods (food, OTC meds, pre-cleared durable medical equipment). No deduction whatsoever for physician time, clinic visits, therapy sessions, or mobile-unit operating months.  
5. **3D-printed devices** → Limited to pre-FDA-cleared or 510(k)-exempt designs only (crutches, basic walkers, finger splints). All Class II devices (CPAP, powered wheelchairs) purchased commercially and donated.  
6. **Security systems** → Standard metal detectors + basic CCTV only. Hyperspectral threat-detection airlocks permanently removed (ITAR/EAR violation).  
7. **Maximum realistic scale (2075)** → 62–78 million individuals served annually (≈18–22 % of U.S. population) – aligned with largest existing U.S. charities + growth curve.  
8. **Revised net after-tax cost (2075 steady-state)** → ≈$15–$18 billion/year (≈11–13 % of projected Earth-Star EBITDA) – still expensive, genuine philanthropy.

All references contradicting these Version 3.0 corrections are permanently withdrawn.
