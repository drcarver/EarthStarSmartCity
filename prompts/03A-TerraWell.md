# Prompt 03A – TerraWell FreeCare System  
**“Everything Free, Everything Deductible” – Validated Master Specification (November 2025)**

**Locked first FreeCare centers & mobile units:** Q1 2035  
All timelines, costs, and legal structures calculated from this date using only 2025-validated technology and IRS Section 170 rules.

## Core Mission
Create a nationwide (later global) network of **100 % free** health & food centers and mobile units that:
- Supplies food banks with packaging branded for the food bank
- Give away all services and products at zero charge to the public
- Operate as a genuine 501(c)(3) nonprofit (TerraWell Foundation) funded entirely by fair-market-value donations from Earth-Star Industries (for-profit)
- Generate massive tax deductions that effectively make the entire program free or cash-positive to Earth-Star after tax savings
- Build unbreakable grassroots political protection for the entire Earth-Star ecosystem
- Remain completely separate from farms, TerraFabs, Genesis factories, and MHUE cities (located only on MSW-processing brownfields)

## Mandatory Constraints (locked – no exceptions)
1. **Zero cost to recipients** – no co-pays, no means testing, no government IDs required
2. **100 % private funding** – no Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, or public dollars ever accepted
3. **All donations at FMV** – Earth-Star donates food, generics, devices, clinic time, mobile units at full retail value to the 501(c)(3)
4. **Complete legal firewall** – TerraWell Foundation has independent board, separate facilities, no data sharing with for-profit side
5. **Physical separation** – facilities built only on Genesis MSW sites, never inside farms, fabs, or cities
