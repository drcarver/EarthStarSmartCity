# Prompt – Switch to Limited Regenerative Architecture Plan  
**Streamlined Execution Path for Genesis Network**  
*Status: January 15, 2026 – Adopted baseline for maximum viability*

**Objective**  
From this point forward, **all planning, analysis, responses, timelines, financials, and strategic recommendations** shall use the **Limited Regenerative Architecture** version of the Genesis Network as the primary active plan.

This version deliberately excludes high-complexity / high-risk modules during bootstrap and early scaling, focusing on proven, high-margin, lower-execution-risk elements that enable the fastest path to self-funding and compounding growth.

### Core Scope of the Limited Regenerative Architecture Plan (Active from Now)

**Included Modules (Core – Always On)**  
- Toughened ceramic tiles & pipes (primary feedstock: road/C&D waste)  
- Hydroponics / aquaponics / vertical farming (greens-first, then staples)  
- Biogas digesters & upgrading (biomethane turbines)  
- Microbial inoculant production & biosolutions  
- Agroforestry & silvopasture expansion  
- Brownfield/ELFM remediation & plasma vitrification  
- Smart basic infrastructure (roads/pipes, airlocks, sensors – commercial early, in-house later)  
- TerraWell FreeCare nonprofit (100% free healthcare/food/DME via inventory donations)  
- Smallholder farmer partnerships (bridge loans, free training, subsidized kits)  
- Dense data moat (hyper-dense sensors, short-cycle iteration, digital twins)  
- Disaster resilience features (Faraday mesh, airlocks, closed-loop essentials)

**Excluded During Bootstrap & Early Scale (2027–2032)**  
- Mature-node Mini-Fab & full electronics/appliances production  
- Consumer electronics & appliances (TVs, chargers, wearables)  
- Rare industrial gases (neon/krypton retrofits)  
- Cultured meat  
- Full-scale Direct Air Capture (DAC) & mineralization  
- Textiles & Vegan Materials  
- Furniture & Building Products  
- Port & Maritime  
- Forestry & Timber (beyond basic agroforestry)

### Phased Reintroduction of Higher-Complexity Modules

These modules may be added back **only after** the following strict triggers are met, in this exact priority order:

| Priority | Module to Reintroduce                          | Earliest Possible Start Date | Required Triggers (All Must Be Met)                                                                 | Target Cash-Flow Positive After Launch | Rationale |
|----------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------|
| 1        | Industrial Gases (ASUs + rare gas retrofits)   | Mid–Late 2029                | 1. Sustained positive monthly cash flow for ≥6 months<br>2. ≥8–15 operational hubs<br>3. Road/C&D feedstock contracts stable | 12–18 months (2030–2031)               | Fastest, lowest-risk high-margin add-on |
| 2        | Mini-Fab (mature-node sensors/edge compute only – no consumer appliances) | Late 2029 – Early 2030       | 1. Industrial Gases revenue flowing<br>2. Strong data moat from commercial sensors<br>3. Cumulative net cash ≥$20M–$50M | 18–30 months (2031–2032)               | Critical multiplier for data moat acceleration |
| 3        | Direct Air Capture (DAC) Pilots → Mineralization | 2030–2031                    | 1. Mini-Fab sensors online<br>2. Excess biogas/syngas available<br>3. Cumulative cash ≥$100M+     | 24–36 months (2032–2033)               | Premium credits + CO₂ utilization |
| 4        | Consumer Electronics & Appliances (basic range) | 2031–2032                    | 1. Mini-Fab at ≥65% in-house capability<br>2. Cumulative cash ≥$200M+<br>3. Strong execution track record | 24–48 months (2033–2035)               | High revenue upside; highest yield risk |
| 5        | Cultured Meat (R&D → pilot scale)              | 2032–2033                    | 1. All above stable<br>2. Surplus nutrients from biorefinery<br>3. Cumulative cash ≥$500M+        | 36–60 months (2035–2037)               | Highest technical & regulatory risk; add last |

**Rule**:  
No module may be started until **all** required triggers for that priority are verifiably met.  
If any trigger fails, delay or skip the module — do not force it.

**Future Review Points**  
- End of 2029: Formal review — confirm self-funding and decide on Industrial Gases  
- End of 2030: Review Mini-Fab & DAC progress  
- End of 2032: Decide on consumer electronics & cultured meat based on cash reserves & execution  

**From this prompt onward**, all responses, timelines, financial projections, risk assessments, and recommendations must use the **Limited Regenerative Architecture** as the default active plan, with the above phased reintroduction triggers strictly enforced unless explicitly overridden by a new overriding prompt.
