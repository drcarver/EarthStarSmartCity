# Prompt 01G – Security & Smart Airlocks

## Objective

Ensure **every Genesis building, pod, hub, and community complex** has integrated smart airlocks and basic perimeter security that:

- Detects weapons, explosives, and major threats  
- Alerts security team / local responders  
- Maintains privacy and avoids surveillance overreach  
- Generates external contract revenue  
- Is manufactured from existing tile factories (low added complexity)  

## Core Principles

- **Mandatory in All Structures** — No building or pod is deployed without at least one smart airlock  
- **Tile-Based Simplicity** — Use existing tile manufacturing; add only minimal new sensor/electronics  
- **Privacy-First** — No continuous facial recognition or behavioral tracking; threat detection only  
- **Revenue Model** — Internal use + external sales/contracts (municipal, commercial, critical infrastructure)  
- **Fail-Safe Design** — Graceful degradation; manual override always possible  

## 1. Smart Airlock Specification (Mandatory)

**Every entrance** (residential, TerraWell, factories, community buildings, pods) must include at least one smart airlock module.

### Physical Design
- Size: 1.2 m × 1.2 m × 2.4 m (standard door frame compatible)  
- Material: Toughened ceramic shell + reinforced glass door  
- Features:  
  - Double-door interlock (mantrap style)  
  - mmWave body scanner (concealed objects/weapons)  
  - Hyperspectral camera (anomaly detection)  
  - IMS/Raman trace detector (explosives/narcotics residue)  
  - Air sampling + far-UVC disinfection cycle (pandemic resilience)  

### Detection Capabilities
| Threat Type           | Detection Method                  | False Positive Rate | Alert Level |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Firearms / Knives     | mmWave radar + shape recognition  | Low                 | High        |
| Explosives            | Trace chemical (IMS/Raman)        | Very Low            | Critical    |
| Narcotics             | Trace chemical (IMS/Raman)        | Low                 | Medium      |
| Anomalous behavior    | Gait/motion anomaly (optional AI) | Medium              | Low-Medium  |

### Operation
- Normal entry: Scan → green light → inner door opens (2–4 seconds)  
- Threat detected: Red light + lockdown + silent alert to Security LLC / local responders  
- Manual override: Emergency physical key or admin badge  

## 2. Basic Security Tile (Perimeter & Internal)

**Purpose**: Low-cost, tile-integrated detection for outer perimeters and internal zones.

### Features
- mmWave radar + IR multispectral sensor  
- Acoustic anomaly detection  
- Embedded compute for local processing  
- Blind-mate interconnect to airlock/security pod  

**Deployment**  
- Exterior walls/perimeter fencing: 1 tile every 10–20 m  
- Internal hallways/public spaces: 1 tile every 50–100 m²  

## 3. Security Coordination Pod (Optional but Recommended)

**Purpose**: Central hub for 5–50 airlock/tile cluster.

### Features
- AI alert triage  
- Drone dispatch (basic quadcopter)  
- Integration with RTK tiles for precise incident location  
- Manual monitoring station  

**When used**: Large hubs, TerraWell centers, community complexes.

## 4. Manufacturing & Cost (Mature Network)

**Smart Airlock Module**  
- Produced in tile factories (ceramic shell + sensor embed)  
- Cost: $80k–$200k per unit  
- Affiliate selling price: $300k–$700k (includes installation/training)  

**Security Tile**  
- Same production line as other tiles  
- Cost: $120–$250 per tile  
- Selling price: $400–$900  

**Revenue Model**  
- Internal use: 0 (mandatory)  
- External sales/contracts: Municipal buildings, schools, warehouses, critical infrastructure  
- Est. annual revenue: $50–$200M per mature hub (external contracts)  

## 5. Viability & Strategic Notes

- **Minimal Complexity** — Uses existing tile manufacturing; adds only 2–3 new sensor types  
- **Political Defensibility** — Framed as safety/compliance infrastructure (not surveillance)  
- **Revenue Flywheel** — External contracts fund internal deployment  
- **Resilience Boost** — Airlocks + basic perimeter protect against pandemics, active threats, theft  
- **Scalability** — Mandatory but low-cost → every hub/affiliate gets protection without delaying bootstrap  

This is the simplest, most deployable security layer that still delivers real value — protecting people and assets while generating external revenue.
