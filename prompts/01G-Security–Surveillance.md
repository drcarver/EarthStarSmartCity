## Objective

Ensure that **every Mother Hub and daughter hub** meets a strict, auditable **security minimum standard** before seeding, including:

- Smart airlock deployment at every entrance  
- Perimeter/internal security tiles coverage  
- Optional coordination pod integration for clusters of ≥5 airlocks  
- Full operational verification under fail-safe and emergency conditions  

**Non-compliance** → automatic disqualification from seeding or affiliate authorization.

## Compliance Gates (All Mandatory)

### 1. Smart Airlock Gate

| Requirement | Threshold | Verification |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| Entrances covered | 100% of pod/building entrances | Audit logs + drone survey |
| Threat detection | Firearms, knives, explosives, narcotics | Test drills quarterly |
| Operational response | Lockdown + silent alert <5 sec | Simulation drill reports |
| Manual override | Emergency key/badge functional | On-site inspection |
| Maintenance | Sensor calibration every 6 months | Maintenance logs |

**Kill-switch:** Any entrance without a functioning airlock → Mother Hub cannot seed.

---

### 2. Security Tile Gate

| Requirement | Threshold | Verification |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| Perimeter coverage | 1 tile per 10–20 m | Drone/visual audit |
| Internal coverage | 1 tile per 50–100 m² | Floorplan cross-check |
| Sensor function | mmWave, IR multispectral, acoustic | Monthly automated test report |
| Network integration | Connected to hub control system | Live test telemetry |

**Kill-switch:** Any >5% tile failure or network isolation.

---

### 3. Coordination Pod Gate (Clustered Installations)

| Requirement | Threshold | Verification |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| Cluster coverage | ≥5 airlocks | Layout verification |
| AI triage operational | 24/7 auto-alert | System simulation |
| Drone dispatch readiness | <10 sec from alert | Test exercise |
| RTK tile integration | Correct position mapping ±3 cm | Integration test |
| Manual override | Human operator access | Drill inspection |

**Mandatory if hub >5 airlocks**; optional otherwise.

---

### 4. Manufacturing & Supply Chain Gate

| Requirement | Threshold |
|------------|----------|
| Airlock production | Mature tile factory, embedded sensors | Production report |
| Redundant sourcing | ≥2 suppliers per sensor type | Supplier verification |
| Spare inventory | ≥5% of deployed units | Inventory audit |
| Installation training | 100% staff certified | Training records |

**Kill-switch:** Single-supplier dependency on critical sensor component.

---

### 5. Operational Viability Gate

| Requirement | Threshold |
|------------|----------|
| Power resilience | ≥72h blackout survival per unit | Test record |
| False positive rate | <5% per quarter | Incident logs |
| Maintenance SLA | ≤24h response | Maintenance dashboard |
| Emergency scenario tested | Fire, intrusion, power loss | Drill records |

**Kill-switch:** Any airlock fails emergency drill.

## Financial & Strategic Notes

- **Cost (Mature Network):**  
  - Airlock: $80k–$200k/unit  
  - Security tile: $120–$250/unit  
- **Affiliate sale potential:** $50–$200M/year per mature hub  
- **Strategic rationale:**  
  - Mandatory baseline protection for staff, assets, biology  
  - Enables revenue from municipal/commercial contracts  
  - Scales with hub size; minimal complexity for maximum coverage  
- **Privacy-first:** No continuous surveillance; threat detection only
