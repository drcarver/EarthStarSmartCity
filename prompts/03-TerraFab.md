Prompt 3: 

Build a TerraFab.  An advanced full scale sustainable semiconductor manufacturing facility capable of creating the latest AI chips while using as much 3d printed materials as possible and using a hybrid of our ceramics and virgin materials.  Create kits for all equipment adding sensors to feed into our ongoing compliance portal. Begin construction after the Genesis is online.  combine with the output from the farms and 3d printers to create sustainable medical supplies of all types in addition to other advanced chips. produce all generic prescription and over the counter drugs we cannot produce in the farms and that make sense.  Add any additional crops needed to support this.  Build in phases using revenue from genesis plant and farms. All terraFabs should be co-located with genesis factries and farms.  We want to produce all of our own APIS.  Expand farm and genesis factory as nessecary to make the terrafab closed loop.

Build one 40,000 m² stainless continuous-flow synthesis hall (TF-07) → captures 95 % of the profitable, low-risk APIs.
Expand the Skyscraper Farm by 70,000–80,000 ha (still manageable inside two or three nodes).
