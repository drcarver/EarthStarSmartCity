# Prompt 02D – Genesis Network: Large-Scale Smart Display Walls  
**Interactive, WiFi-Enabled, Compute/Storage-Integrated, Self-Powered**

## Objective

Define the complete specification, manufacturing process, integration requirements, financial model, deployment strategy, and viability enhancements for **large-scale smart display walls** constructed exclusively from **Smart Furniture Surface Tiles** (and their outdoor-hardened variants). These modular, snap-together walls transform building façades, community plazas, retail fronts, tower exteriors, TerraWell centers, public spaces, and internal surfaces into dynamic, revenue-generating, community-serving infrastructure.

Core goals:  
- Deliver high-resolution, sunlight-readable, multi-user interactive digital displays  
- Provide free, secure public WiFi hotspots with isolated guest networking  
- Embed hot-swappable compute/storage modules for local AI inference, edge services, and federated learning participation  
- Achieve near-zero grid dependency through BIPV solar + piezoelectric harvesting + AWG condensate microchannel cooling  
- Ensure full compatibility with the Genesis closed-loop ecosystem, dense sensor nets, digital twins, smart city standards, and sustainable building codes

## 5. Integration & Use Cases

- **Retail Façades** → Dynamic product showcases, real-time pricing, interactive queries (“Show local organic options”), shopper WiFi  
- **Community Hubs & Plazas** → Public information walls (sequestration data, events), civic engagement, free broadband hotspots  
- **TerraWell Centers** → Offline health education content, telehealth query walls, free WiFi for patients/visitors  
- **Tower Buildings** → Full-height media skins doubling as edge compute clusters for hub-wide AI services  
- **Public Spaces** → Wayfinding, emergency alerts, tourism info, broadband access points  

**Viability & Integration Notes**  
Large-scale smart display walls convert passive architectural surfaces into active, revenue-generating assets while preserving the Network’s core principles of modularity, self-powering (BIPV/piezo/AWG cooling), and closed-loop resource use. They align with smart city standards (ISO/TC 268), sustainable building codes (ISO 14001), and the Genesis data moat (local digital twins optimize content delivery and load balancing). Deployment occurs exclusively on private Network/affiliate land, minimizing regulatory burden. Public WiFi complies with FCC guest network guidelines (isolated, time/session-limited). The combination of interactive AI, free broadband, and edge compute creates strong community value, monetization flywheel, and social/political goodwill.
