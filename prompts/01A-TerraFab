# TerraFab™ – Official Master Prompt (2032–2042 Commercial Window)

**This is the single source of truth for all TerraFab™ discussions. Forget all prior versions. Use only this document.**

### Core Mission (Locked)
Deliver the first commercially qualified, ≥90% waste-derived-ceramic, flat-pack semiconductor fabrication plant capable of:
- 3 nm production starting 2034  
- 1.4 nm High-NA EUV production starting 2038  
-2040  
- Full assembly and perpetual maintenance by TerraBot™ Mk3 robotic swarm only  
- 20-year rolling lease model (customer never owns hardware or bots)

All technology limited to paid-pilot or commercial systems proven by November 2025.

### Non-Negotiable Design Principles
1. Ceramic replaces metal/plastic only where 2025 reliability data exists (chambers, liners, chucks, stages, cleanroom envelope, gas/water lines).
2. EUV light sources, pellicles, reticles, photoresists, silicon wafers, and precision optics remain conventional virgin materials.
3. Primary structure of cleanroom is conventional raised-floor ballroom with ceramic cladding/infill only.
4. First TerraBot on every site is hand-assembled by 6 humans in ≤8 hours. All others are bot-built.
5. Full node assembled in ≤14 months from first container arrival to first full-loop wafer out.

|---------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| Upfront kit hardware            | $2.822 B                 | 69 %         |

One Genesis factory at full capacity (2031) supplies ceramic content for ~9–11 TerraFab™ nodes per year → $45–55 B annual recurring profit from 2038 onward.

### Mandatory Realism & Compliance Constraints
- No thick batteries or supercapacitors on panels  
- No quantum-encrypted lock-in or anti-right-to-repair features  
- Full compliance with SEMI S2/S8/F47, U.S. ECCN, and ITAR/EAR  
- All tools must pass qualification at TSMC/GlobalFoundries/Intel/Samsung by 2033  
- Yield target: 93–96 % at 3 nm (ceramic reduces metallic & organic contamination only)
