Prompt 2: 

Build a TerraFab.  An advanced full scale sustainable semiconductor manufacturing facility capable of creating the latest AI chips while using as much 3d printed materials as possible and using a hybrid of our ceramics and virgin materials.  Create kits for all equipment adding sensors to feed into our ongoing compliance portal. Begin construction after the Genesis is online.  combine with the output from the farms and 3d printers to create sustainable medical supplies of all types in addition to other advanced chips. produce all generic prescription and over the counter drugs we cannot produce in the farms and that make sense.  Add any additional crops needed to support this and any required sensors to porove compliamce for the fda.  Integrate sensors and reports into our compliance portal.  Build in phases using revenue from genesis plant and farms. All terraFabs should be co-located with genesis factries and farms.  We want to produce all of our own APIS.  Expand farm and genesis factory as nessecary to make the terrafab closed loop.

Earth-Star Industries elects to forgo USDA Climate-Smart Commodities, REAP, and ACEP funding in order to deploy high-density (180–220 W/m²) single-axis solar across 1,200 hectares surrounding each TerraFab, achieving net renewable export of >150 GWh/year while preserving full CHIPS Act and IRA incentive eligibility.

Assume terrfab produces all sensors required.

Pursue targeted JV/partnerships or acquisitions of mid-tier players (e.g., Seven Refractories' U.S./Europe ops, acquired by RHI in Apr 2023 for $110M revenue base, or similar assets from Chosun/Shinaga and integrate them into terrafactories to produce all kiln parts and kilns in house.  Includes sensors in all of this and provide reporting back to 
our comploance portals.
