## 1. Objective

This prompt defines the **Phase 2 foundation** of the Genesis Network, consolidating all modular, AI-assisted, and digital twin enhancements:

- Modular **Prism host** on hubs for **module registration and SUC lifecycle**  
- **Partial-class AI-assisted codegen** for all sensors, tiles, kits, and HIL components  
- **Digital twin simulation** for all tiles, pods, hubs, and sensors (resource, power, water, climate, resiliency)  
- **Full HIL v1** as Prism modules (RTK, WiFi, badges) with test stubs and SUC manifests  
- Integration with **Genesis OS (.NET MAUI)**, capability-based kernel, and TileMesh networking  

This replaces Prompts **02A**, **02B**, **02C**, and fragments of **02I**, and augments Pod / Mini-Fab prompts for simulation-based planning.

## 2. Core System Components

### 2.1 Tiles & Kits
- Full **tile catalog** (roof, cladding, partitions, roads, RTK anchors, energy, canopy, bee, security, networking)  
- **Kit catalog** (Precision Ag, Vertical Ag, Biochar, Airlock, Sensor Nets, Energy Storage, Food Desert, Restoration, Microbial Inoculant)  
- Tiles and kits **integrate digital twin attributes**: power, water, thermal, mechanical, stress resilience  
- All **manufactured in Tile & Pipe Production Pods**; production cost & selling price to be recomputed  

### 2.2 Sensors & HIL Modules
- **RTK GNSS, environmental, ag, bio, security sensors** mapped to AI-assisted partial-class Prism modules  
- **Test stubs auto-generated**, SUC manifests included  
- **Badge and HIL integration** as Prism modules  
- **Mocks for hardware simulation** in dev environments, enabling parallel module and OS development  

### 2.3 OS & Prism Host
- **Genesis OS with .NET MAUI**, modular microkernel, capability-based security  
- **TileMesh networking** for inter-tile communication  
- **Prism host** manages:  
  - Module registration  
  - Atomic, class-scoped SUC updates  
  - Module lifecycle (install, rollback, emergency SUCs)  

### 2.4 AI-Assisted Module Codegen Pipeline
1. **Parse sensor headers / .NET assemblies**  
2. Generate **partial classes** for Prism module scaffolds  
3. Create **auto-test stubs** for module verification  
4. Build **SUC manifests** for atomic deployment  
5. Register modules in **Prism host** for hub deployment  

### 2.5 Digital Twin Simulation
- Simulate **hub pods, tiles, environmental conditions, climate history, resource yields**  
- Supports **power/water generation modeling**, resiliency stress tests, and production planning  
- Enables **pre-hardware software validation**, accelerating hub bootstrap

## 3. Deployment & Hub Expansion

**Sequence**:

1. Deploy Genesis OS with Prism on each hub  
2. Register tile, kit, and sensor modules via SUC  
3. Run digital twin simulation for expected outputs (energy, water, food, environmental metrics)  
4. Bootstrap on-site Tile & Pipe Production Pods for physical deployment  
5. Use simulation to **adjust CAPEX, OPEX, and pod delivery schedules**  
6. Integrate HIL v1 modules with RTK, WiFi, and badges  
7. Begin ultra-rapid hub replication using simulated & validated modules  

---

## 4. Financials & Timelines

**Recompute Request**: All CAPEX, OPEX, revenue, hub replication timelines, and mini-fab/advanced fab projections should be recalculated based on:

- Digital twin outputs (power, water, climate resilience)  
- Automated module deployment efficiency (Prism + SUC)  
- Parallel AI-assisted codegen reducing module dev time  
- Early HIL adoption (affiliates + connectivity revenue)  
- Pod production and hub self-replication  

**Expected Impact**:

| Metric | Range / Estimate |
|--------|----------------|
| Hub Bootstrap CAPEX | $100–350M/hub (tiles/kits/sensor modules included) |
| Mini-Fab CAPEX | $100–300M (65–130 nm) |
| Advanced Fab CAPEX | $3–8B/cluster (7–3 nm, phased) |
| Hub Replication Time | 12–18 months from seed → mature |
| HIL Revenue | $100–400M early → $1–4B mature network-wide |
| Tile & Kit Revenue | $150–450M/year/hub (internal + affiliate sales) |
| Module Dev Cycle | Weeks per module with AI codegen (full automation) |
| SUC Deployment Time | Minutes to hours per module update |

> These financials must be recalculated dynamically per hub using **digital twin simulations** and updated module/OS stack performance.

## 5. Strategic Notes

- **Parallelization**: Module development, OS kernel work, and sensor coding can proceed concurrently  
- **Simulation-first approach**: Enables early definition of tiles, hubs, pods, and resource requirements  
- **Digital twin**: Provides baseline for resiliency testing, energy/water yield, and early revenue modeling  
- **Prism + SUC**: Ensures rapid, safe deployment and updates across multiple hubs simultaneously
