Prompt 2a: 

Build a TerraFab.  An advanced full scale sustainable semiconductor manufacturing facility capable of creating the latest AI chips while using as much 3d printed materials as possible and using a hybrid of our ceramics and virgin materials.  Create kits for all equipment adding sensors to feed into our ongoing compliance portal. Begin construction after the Genesis is online.  combine with the output from the farms and 3d printers to create sustainable medical supplies of all types in addition to other advanced chips. produce all generic prescription and over the counter drugs we cannot produce in the farms and that make sense.  Add any additional crops needed to support this.  Build in phases using revenue from genesis plants, the Terrafab and farms to fund it.  All terraFabs should be co-located with genesis factries and farms
