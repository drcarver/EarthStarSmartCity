# Prompt 00 -  Genesis-EarthStar Regenerative System: Overview

## Project Overview

The **Genesis-EarthStar Regenerative System** is a modular, regenerative, closed-loop ecosystem deployed on distressed or bankrupt farmland (prioritizing mature orchards and nut farms in regions like California's Central Valley). It produces food, energy, water, and high-value byproducts while achieving **95–99% resource closure** at maturity, drawing from NASA BLSS/ECLSS principles but optimized for terrestrial scalability, rapid cash flow, and cooperative network growth.

The system bootstraps via high-value hydroponic greens, transplanted orchard yields, and biogas, self-funding expansions through revenue. Key enhancements include:

# Sensors and Digital Twins in the Genesis Network

## Overview

The Genesis Network's competitive edge and long-term viability rest on a **dense, intelligent sensor ecosystem** coupled with **site-specific live digital twins**. This instrumentation generates a compounding **data moat** through thousands of short-cycle experiments per year, enabling ruthless data-driven optimization, predictive analytics, anomaly detection, and continuous system evolution. Sensors and digital twins also ensure proactive compliance with relevant standards across agriculture, infrastructure, environment, and smart systems.

## Sensor Strategy

### Phased Evolution
- **Initial Phase**: Deploy standards-compliant commercial sensors for immediate interoperability, regulatory acceptance, and baseline data collection.
- **Rapid Iteration**: Leverage short growing cycles (30–90 days for crops, weekly for microalgae/BSFL) to generate proprietary performance data within months.
- **Customization**: Use cycle data to identify gaps and evolve to advanced in-house sensors (e.g., bio-sensors, mmWave radar).

### Redundancy & Fault Tolerance
- 3–5x redundancy per critical measurement point.
- AI-driven detection of sensor drift/failure using cross-validation across redundant arrays.

### Advanced Sensor Types
- **Electrochemical & Optical**: Nutrient, pH, pathogen detection.
- **Nanobiosensors & Microbial/Whole-Cell**: Soil microbial activity, plant stress.
- **mmWave/IR-UWB Radar**: Passive resident health monitoring (heart rate, respiration, fall detection) in housing.
- **Multispectral & VOC**: Pest/disease early warning in greenhouses.

### AI Integration
- Edge AI for real-time processing (noise reduction, pattern recognition, anomaly flagging).
- Cloud/Network AI trains bespoke models on compounding data for predictive optimization and upgrade suggestions.

### Privacy & Ethics
- Non-intrusive designs (radar preferred over cameras).
- Local/edge processing for sensitive data.
- Opt-in mechanisms for personal health/resident data.

## Ruthless Data-Driven Design and the Digital Moat

### Cycle-by-Cycle Iteration
- Each short cycle produces detailed performance metrics (yields, resource efficiency, failure rates).
- Underperforming designs (e.g., a layout increasing energy use by 10% or reducing yields by 15%) are immediately redesigned and tested in the next cycle.

### Runaway Detection & Redesign
- AI flags anomalies (e.g., vibration indicating kiln wear) and traces root causes.
- Data informs material/process tweaks deployed via snap-in modular tiles.

### Predictive Optimization
- Sensor data vs. weather forecasts refines passive systems (e.g., AWG condenser redesign for better humidity capture).

### Moat Building Mechanism
- **Volume & Velocity**: 10–50x more growth cycles/year than conventional systems → petabyte-scale proprietary data within 3–5 years.
- **Ground Truth Advantage**: Dense, redundant sensors on live hubs provide unmatched accuracy vs. competitors' sparse or modeled data.
- **Flywheel Effect**: More data → better AI → faster optimization → higher yields/efficiency → more resources for sensors → denser data.
- **Uncrossable Lead**: By 2035, the network's AI can predict outcomes with precision unattainable by outsiders, ruthlessly eliminating losing variants and allocating resources to winners.

## Digital Twins Strategy

### Comprehensive Site-Specific Twins
- **4D Live Models**: 3D geometry + time evolution, covering pre-acquisition baseline through full maturity and upgrades.
- **Scope**: Soil/water/contaminants, infrastructure rollout, real-time metrics (yields, closure rates, sequestration, anonymized health).

### Baseline Data Collection
- Full sensor arrays post-acquisition for ground-truth transitions (especially valuable on brownfields/landfills).

### Change Management
- All upgrades simulated in twins first; ranked by NPV/ROI.
- AI bundles high-ROI changes to minimize physical tile swaps (target: 1 every 2–5 years).

### Parallel Legacy Twins
- Models of conventional agriculture/infrastructure built from public data for side-by-side proof of Genesis superiority.

- **Audit-Ready Data**: Blockchain-verified, time-stamped logs for regulators/credits.
- **Standards Leadership**: Selective sharing of anonymized aggregates influences bodies (ISO, IEC, NIST, USDA, EPA), positioning Genesis as the reference implementation.

This integrated sensor-digital twin ecosystem transforms the Genesis Network into a **self-learning, self-optimizing platform** with an uncrossable data moat and built-in regulatory resilience.

## Overview of the Initial Bootstrapping Facility

To achieve the fastest possible startup with minimal regulatory hurdles and capital outlay, the **initial ceramic tile production factory** is bootstrapped inside a **large leased industrial tent** (also referred to as a temporary fabric structure or clear-span tent) on leased or distressed farmland. This approach deliberately avoids the permitting and environmental review requirements associated with permanent structures or waste-intensive sites (brownfields/landfills) in the earliest phase.

The tent serves as a fully functional, climate-controlled, lights-out-capable production hub that can be operational within **3–6 months** of site selection. Once the first permanent tile factory (built from its own output tiles) comes online, the tent and all leased equipment are phased out, eliminating ongoing lease costs.

### Key Characteristics of the Leased Tent Facility

- **Structure Type**: Heavy-duty commercial/industrial tent (e.g., 50–100 m length × 30–50 m width × 10–15 m height clear-span fabric structure) with insulated walls, HVAC, dust filtration, and concrete or compacted gravel flooring.
- **Site Requirements**: Leased farmland parcel (10–50 acres) with good road access, three-phase power, and water. No permanent foundation required in most agricultural zones.
- **Regulatory Advantage**: Classified as temporary agricultural or industrial storage/processing structure in most U.S. rural jurisdictions → minimal or no building permits, no environmental impact review.
- **Lease Term**: 2–5 years with early termination clause.
- **Total Footprint**: ~5,000–10,000 m² under roof, allowing parallel tile production and mini-fab lines.

### Production Zones Within the Tent

#### 1. Core Ceramic Tile Production Line (Lights-Out Capable)
- **Raw Material Handling**: Covered external stockpiles for virgin clays, kaolin, feldspar, quartz, and early farm wastes (rice husk, bagasse). Front-end loaders and conveyors feed mixers.
- **Mixing & Forming**: High-capacity pan mixers, extruders, and automated presses for tile forming (structural blocks, cladding panels, pipes, glazing precursors).
- **Drying**: Conveyor-fed tunnel dryers using waste heat recovery.
- **Firing**: Leased high-temperature tunnel kilns or shuttle kilns (natural gas or electric) capable of 1,200–1,400°C for toughened ceramics.
- **Licensed Plasma Torch Integration**: Leased or licensed plasma vitrification unit for initial residue processing and early slag toughening experiments.
- **Automation Level**: Robotic handling, conveyor systems, and vision-guided stacking → designed for lights-out operation with telepresence oversight.
- **Initial Output**: 50,000–150,000 m² of structural/insulating tiles per month (sufficient to begin permanent factory construction within 6–12 months).

#### 2. Leased Lights-Out Commercial Mini-Fab for Sensors, Edge Computers, and Robotics
- **Purpose**: Provide immediate in-house production of critical electronics (sensors, edge AI computers, robot controllers) to enable full automation and data moat from Day 1, bypassing long lead times for commercial suppliers.
- **Facility Type**: Leased turnkey "mini-fab" or small-scale semiconductor assembly/cleanroom module installed inside a dedicated zoned area of the tent (ISO 7–8 cleanroom tent-within-tent).
- **Technology Level**: Commercial mature-node (65–130 nm) packaging and assembly line licensed from established providers (e.g., outsourced semiconductor assembly and test — OSAT model).
- **Key Capabilities**:
  - Die bonding, wire bonding, flip-chip assembly
  - PCB fabrication and SMT lines for edge computers
  - Sensor packaging (multispectral, environmental, radar modules)
  - Final assembly and testing of small robotics controllers and DC appliance boards
  - Integration of early metallurgical-grade silicon from rice husk ash (as available)
- **Automation**: Fully lights-out capable with robotic die handlers, automated optical inspection, and telepresence monitoring stations.
- **Output**: 
  - 100,000–500,000 sensors/year initially
  - 10,000–50,000 edge computers and robot controllers/year
  - Sufficient to instrument the pilot hub and begin data-driven iteration cycles
- **Transition Plan**: Production ramps as farm biomass increases; full capability moves to permanent on-site MiniFabs once tile factories are operational.

### Supporting Systems
- **Power**: Leased temporary generators + grid tie-in; supplemented by early commercial solar arrays.
- **Water & Waste**: Mobile water treatment and septic; all process water recirculated.
- **AI/Telepresence Control Room**: Dedicated hardened section with redundant satellite/Starlink uplinks for remote operation and training.
- **Security & Monitoring**: Perimeter sensors, drones, and early self-produced cameras.

### Timeline & Exit Strategy
- **Months 1–3**: Site preparation, tent erection, equipment installation.
- **Months 4–12**: Ramp-up to full production; begin construction of first permanent tile factory using tent output.
- **Year 2–3**: Permanent factory online → tent dismantled, equipment sold or relocated, land returned or purchased for expansion.

This leased-tent strategy enables **rapid financial independence** by producing saleable tiles, sensors, and early food/biogas revenues while avoiding regulatory delays associated with waste-heavy or permanent facilities.

# Smart Roads and Infrastructure in the Genesis System

## Overview

The **smart roads and infrastructure** form a critical backbone of the Genesis Network, enabling efficient connectivity, resource distribution, energy management, and data flow across clustered hubs on private land. Designed primarily for internal use within owned farmland clusters, brownfields, and landfill sites, the system prioritizes **DC-dominant power distribution**, modular ceramic construction, embedded intelligence, and multi-functional integration to achieve high efficiency, resilience, and near-zero maintenance.

All roads, pipes, and supporting infrastructure are constructed exclusively from **Genesis-produced toughened ceramic tiles and pipes**, ensuring full closed-loop material sourcing (70–95% from internal farm wastes and ELFM slag).

## Key Features of Smart Roads

- **Structural Base**: Load-bearing ceramic tiles (compressive strength 60–100+ MPa variants) in masonry/block formats. Standard roads use regular compressive designs; high-load zones (e.g., factory access) reinforced with thicker or steel-rebar-embedded variants produced in-house.
- **Surface Layer**: Permeable or impermeable ceramic paving tiles with embedded piezo-electric elements for energy harvesting from vehicle traffic and vibration.
- **Integrated Solar Generation**: Bifacial or semi-transparent BIPV ceramic tiles on elevated sections, medians, or dedicated lanes generate supplementary DC power.
- **Embedded Intelligence**:
  - Self-produced silicon sensors (temperature, strain, vibration, weight-in-motion, permeability, soiling).
  - Redundant arrays (3–5x) for fault detection and predictive maintenance.
  - MmWave radar and optical sensors for traffic monitoring and autonomous vehicle guidance.
- **Thermal Management**: Embedded conduits for waste heat circulation (from biorefineries/kilns) to prevent ice formation; AI-triggered resistive traces (DC-powered) for backup de-icing.
- **Lighting**: Full-cutoff, shielded, warm-CCT DC LEDs with motion sensors, astronomical timers, and network-wide sky quality feedback for dark sky compliance.
- **Connectivity**: Integrated fiber-optic conduits within ceramic pipes for high-speed internet backbone.

## Smart Utility Pipes and Distribution Network

- **Ceramic Smart Pipes**: Multi-channel modular pipes carrying:
  - Potable water
  - Recycled grey/blackwater
  - Biogas
  - DC power cables
  - Data/fiber
  - Compressed air (optional)
- **Bidirectional Flow**: Homes and modules can export/import water, power, and data through the network.
- **Leak & Flow Monitoring**: Embedded flow, pressure, and acoustic sensors with real-time AI anomaly detection.
- **Robotic Delivery Potential**: Larger pipe variants designed to accommodate small robotic pods for food/material transport between nodes.

## DC-Dominant Smart Grid Integration

- **Primary Design**: Entire internal grid operates on DC to minimize conversion losses (most loads: LEDs, electronics, appliances, motors are DC-native).
- **Private Land Advantage**: As infrastructure is on privately owned land, it avoids public utility regulations and most AC-dominant building codes.
- **Interconnection**: Microgrid controllers convert to AC only at export points for national grid tie-in and surplus power sales.
- **Energy Sources**: Direct feed from agrivoltaic arrays, on-site PV, wind, and biomethane turbines.
- **Storage**: Integrated battery banks (from internal electronics loop) and thermal storage in ceramic mass.

## Standards Compliance and Implementation

The smart roads and infrastructure are designed to meet or exceed relevant international and national standards for interoperability, safety, sustainability, and performance:

- **ISO/TC 268 – Sustainable Cities and Communities**: Full alignment with smart city indicators for energy, water, transport, and waste.
- **ISO/TC 204 – Intelligent Transport Systems**: Compliance with ITS standards for road monitoring, vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, and data exchange.
- **IEC SyC Smart Cities**: Electrotechnical aspects of smart city systems, including DC microgrids and embedded systems.
- **IEEE 2030 – Smart Grid Interoperability**: Guidelines for grid architecture, DC distribution, and energy management.
- **NIST Smart Grid Framework**: Cybersecurity and interoperability baselines incorporated via edge AI processing.

# Land Acquisition Strategy: Purchasing Distressed Farmland and Acquiring Mature Orchards/Nut Farms

## Overview

The Genesis Network leverages the ongoing surge in U.S. farm bankruptcies (particularly in California's Central Valley almond, pistachio, and walnut sectors as of late 2025) to acquire **distressed or bankrupt orchards and nut farms** at significantly discounted prices. This farm-first approach enables low- or zero-cash entry, rapid revenue generation from existing mature trees, and front-loading of fruit/nut diversity for MyPlate compliance and high-margin outputs.

Key benefits:
- Immediate yields (80–95% of normal within 1–3 years post-transplant)
- Accelerated cash flow to fund tile factories and infrastructure
- Clustered parcels (10–50 km radius) for hub scalability without requiring contiguous mega-farms![](grok_render_searched_image_card_json={"cards":[{"cardId":"1cd953","imageId":"0","size":"LARGE"},{"cardId":"26d8e9","imageId":"1","size":"LARGE"},{"cardId":"34f2d2","imageId":"2","size":"LARGE"}]})

*Examples of distressed almond orchards in California impacted by low prices, water restrictions, and bankruptcies (2024–2025).*

## Step 1: Identifying and Purchasing Distressed Land

- **Market Conditions (December 2025)**: Chapter 12 farm bankruptcies have surged 55–70% year-over-year, driven by low nut prices, high input costs, interest rates (~9%), water regulations (SGMA), and trade uncertainties. California leads with major filings in almonds (e.g., thousands of acres abandoned/removed) and pistachios/walnuts.
- **Target Regions**: Central Valley (Fresno, Kern, Madera, Tulare counties) for almonds/pistachios; northern areas for walnuts/apples/pears.
- **Acquisition Methods**:
  - Bankruptcy auctions and distressed sales (prices often $2,000–$3,500/acre vs. prior peaks of $30,000–$60,000/acre for almonds).
  - Direct purchases from exiting multi-generational farmers.
  - Clustered parcels (100–600 acres each) to form 4,000–5,000 ha hubs.
- **Financing**:
  - **USDA FSA Direct Farm Ownership Loans**: Up to 100% financing, no or minimal down payment for qualifying beginning/regenerative farmers; low rates (~4.5–5.75% in 2025).
  - **Down Payment Program**: Only 5% down for beginning farmers.
  - Guaranteed loans (up to 95% guarantee) for additional leverage.
  - Eligibility: <10 years farming experience; own <30% of county average farm size; substantial participation.

This enables pilots with $0–$50K personal cash on 500–2,000+ acres.

## Step 2: Acquiring and Integrating Mature Trees

- **Strategy**: Selectively **transplant 8–15+ year-old mature/semi-mature trees** (apples, pears, walnuts, pistachios, almonds where viable) from acquired distressed sites into agrivoltaic silvopasture zones on core hub parcels.
- **Process**:
  - Use professional **tree spades** (machinery for digging large root balls) during dormancy (late fall/early spring).
  - Over-plant 10–15% to account for losses.
  - Amend soil with biochar, mycorrhizae, and microbial inoculants.
  - Monitor recovery with AI/sensors; provide precision irrigation from AWG/rain capture.![](grok_render_searched_image_card_json={"cards":[{"cardId":"472584","imageId":"3","size":"LARGE"},{"cardId":"3a2fe0","imageId":"4","size":"LARGE"},{"cardId":"b3ced1","imageId":"5","size":"LARGE"}]})

*Professional tree spade transplantation of mature nut/fruit trees for relocation.*

- **Success Rates & Timeline**: 80–95% survival with best practices; near-full yields in 1–3 years (minimal growth/fruit in Year 1 recovery).
- **Integration**: Elevated single-axis solar trackers (4–6 m clearance) over transplanted orchards for dual-use agrivoltaics:
  - Shade/frost protection for trees
  - Grazing underneath (sheep/goats)
  - Massive rainwater harvesting + panel cooling (+5–10% PV efficiency)![](grok_render_searched_image_card_json={"cards":[{"cardId":"2e67f1","imageId":"6","size":"LARGE"},{"cardId":"ee97a2","imageId":"7","size":"LARGE"},{"cardId":"28034b","imageId":"8","size":"LARGE"}]})

*Agrivoltaic arrays over orchards: solar panels provide shade while allowing continued fruit/nut production and grazing.*

## Impacts on Genesis Network Viability

- **Revenue Acceleration**: High-value fruits/nuts online by 2030–2035 (vs. 2040+ from new plantings).
- **Land Efficiency**: Reduced solar footprint (40–65% savings via high-density trackers); +15–30% overall hub efficiency.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Proven mature varieties; faster MyPlate fruit compliance.
- **Scaling**: Early cash flow funds ceramic transitions and replication kits.

This module de-risks bootstrapping while maximizing regenerative outcomes on reclaimed distressed land.

# Phased Rollout Plan for Genesis System

The phased rollout plan for the Genesis System emphasizes financial independence by starting with commercial greenhouse operations on distressed farmland to generate early revenue. These revenues are used to finance leased tents for initial tile production, bringing manufacturing in-house rapidly while expanding greenhouses in parallel. The plan accelerates to full tile and kit production using leased tents, transitioning to permanent facilities as cash flows allow. All projections are conservative estimates based on 2025 market data: commercial greenhouse setup at $2-4M per ha, annual gross revenue $500k-1M per ha for high-value crops (greens/herbs), industrial tent lease at $80-100 per sq m annually, small-scale ceramic tile factory setup $200k-500k (equipment), and tile revenue $3-5 per sq m manufactured. Assumptions include 50% gross margins initially, scaling to 60-70% with optimization. Timelines start from December 2025 planning, with operations in 2026. Projections are per pilot cluster (initial 500-1,000 acres, ~200-400 ha total land, but focused on greenhouse/tent areas).

- **TerraFab Adjustments**: Focus on mini-fabs ($150–400M each) for mature-node semiconductors/sensors; RHA silicon maximized; stealth variants optional for military.
- **Medical/Pharma**: Botanical APIs from expanded crops; 3D-printed supplies; advanced wheelchairs with biometrics/AI; GMP compliance via sensors/portal.
- **Environmental Loops**: DAC pilots using waste heat; wetland/river restoration kits; selective dam removals with fisheries integration.

## Timeline and Scale Recalibrations
- **Schedule**: Pilots 2027–2030 (1–5 hubs); regional 2031–2035 (20–50 hubs); national 2036–2050 (400–600 hubs, 40–60% U.S. influence).
- **Feasibility Metrics**: Technical 7.5/10; Economic 7/10 (self-funding critical); Environmental 9/10; Political/Social 6.5/10 (farmer focus mitigates backlash). Overall 7.5/10 (60–75% success probability).

## Viability Boosts and Risk Mitigations
- **Aggressive Self-Funding**: Year 1 greens/biogas/tipping fees; mini-fabs by 2032 for electronics margins (60–80%).
- **Political Alignment**: Co-op/LLC structures for hubs; TerraWell humanitarian layer for goodwill.
- **Risks Addressed**: Over-scaling avoided via pilots; antitrust via decentralization; climate extremes tested in data moat.

# Guidelines for Generating a Detailed Response to the Initial Genesis System Prompt

## Purpose of the Response
The response should provide a **comprehensive, self-contained, and detailed overview** of the **Genesis System** as described solely in the initial project prompt (Prompt 1). The goal is to clearly and thoroughly explain the system's design, components, principles, and vision without referencing any subsequent prompts, updates, or refinements.

The response must be presented in a **scrollable Markdown window** (i.e., formatted as complete standalone Markdown suitable for rendering in a Jekyll/GitHub Pages site or similar), ensuring readability with proper headings, sections, bullet points, tables (where appropriate), and logical flow.

## Key Requirements for the Response Structure

1. **Title and Header**
   - Use a clear, descriptive page title (e.g., "Genesis System by EarthStar Technologies").
   - Include Jekyll front matter for compatibility (layout: default).

2. **Main Heading**
   - Start with a top-level heading: "# Genesis System: Detailed Overview"

3. **Section Organization**
   Organize content into logical, hierarchical sections using Markdown headings (##, ###, etc.) that mirror the structure of the initial prompt for maximum fidelity and clarity. Recommended sections include:

   - ## Project Overview

   - ## Core Principles
   - ## Key Products and Outputs
     - Subsections numbered 1–9 exactly matching the prompt's listed modules:
       1. Modular Ceramic Tiles
       2. Hybrid Greenhouse/Aquaponics Modules
       3. Animal Husbandry and Permaculture Extensions
       4. Automated Processing and Biorefinery Modules
       5. Advanced Materials and Electronics
       6. Grey and Blackwater Processing
       7. Telepresence and AI
       8. Smart Infrastructure and Cultural Add-Ons
       9. Staples Production
   - ## Deployment Strategy and Performance Characteristics
   - ## Food Production
   - ## Scaling and Financial Model
   - ## Complete Detayled Phased Plan
   - ## Infrastructure and Community Development
   - ## Resident Benefits
   - ## Summary


4. **Content Guidelines**
   - Use direct, accurate paraphrasing and quotation of key phrases from the initial prompt to preserve intent.
   - Expand explanations where needed for clarity (e.g., what "98–99.9%+ resource closure" means in context).
   - Use bullet points for lists (e.g., food items, core principles, resident benefits).
   - Bold key terms (e.g., **net-positive energy**, **DC-dominant smart grid**) for emphasis.
   - Avoid speculation, additions, or references to later developments (e.g., no mention of farm-first strategy refinements, updated financials, or later kits).

5. **Visual and Readability Enhancements**
   - Employ Markdown tables if listing structured data (e.g., potential future use for resident benefits).
   - Use emphasis (bold, italics) judiciously.
   - Ensure long sections are broken into subsections for scrollability.

##Key updates:
- **Phased Aquaponics**: Hydroponics-only Phase 1 → fish RAS Phase 2.
- **Interim Automation**: Priva Connext (greenhouses) + Pentair AES (RAS); open APIs for custom PoE sensors.
- **Glazing/Lighting**: Separate modular LEDs + commercial semi-transparent BIPV (e.g., Heliene GiPV) initially → transition to custom RHA-derived ceramic-embedded PV tiles.
- **Energy**: Agrivoltaics (Phase 1 roofs) + biogas microturbines (Phase 2+) → net-positive power.
- **Water**: Rainwater harvesting + AWG integrated into tiles → near-100% closure.
- **Ceramics Strategy**: Monolithic/large-format tanks (not modular tiles for tanks); embedded sensors; buildings/pipes tiled.
- **Factory**: Leased tents + equipment (tile production & mini-fab) → permanent ceramic factories.
- **Bots/Drones**: Produce custom tile-laying bots early; drones hybrid (electronics from mini-fab).
- **Financing**: Minimal out-of-pocket ($0–$50k) via USDA FSA beginning farmer loans → Phase 1 revenue fully self-finances afterwards.

 ```

## Output Format
The entire response must be **raw Markdown only**, wrapped in a single code block if necessary for direct copy-paste, but primarily delivered as a complete standalone Markdown document ready for rendering in a scrollable window (e.g., GitHub Pages with Jekyll minimal theme).

**Do not** include any external references, tool calls, or mentions of other prompts/tools in the final delivered Markdown section.

This structure ensures the response is thorough, faithful to the initial prompt, professionally presented, and easily navigable in a scrollable view.
