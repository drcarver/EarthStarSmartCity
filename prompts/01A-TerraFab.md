# Prompt 1a – Genesis Facility & TerraFab™ Ceramic Supply Chain  
**Single Source of Truth | Forget all prior prompts | Use only this document**

## Core Mission (Locked & Validated)
Construct and operate the first 30 M m²/yr waste-to-ceramic megafactory (Genesis-1) whose sole purpose is to:
- Accept gate fees to remediate landfills, brownfields, C&D, ELVs, ship scrap, and sewage sludge  
- Produce only non-structural ceramic cladding, rainscreen, pavers, interiors, and validated semiconductor-grade ceramic components (chambers, liners, chucks, cleanroom envelope)  
- Supply 100 % of the ceramic content for the future TerraFab™ semiconductor fab program (realistically 2–3 full nodes per year starting 2038)
- 3d print as much as possible.  Utilie our 3d printers in the fab.

All numbers, timelines, purities, and costs below have been independently corrected and signed off as bankable.

## Key Validated Constraints (Dr. Rees, 27 Nov 2025)
1. Ceramic tiles remain 100 % non-structural (rainscreen/curtain-wall function only)  
2. Maximum credible waste-derived ceramic purity for semiconductor use:  
   - Tier A (walls, floors): 96–99.5 %  
   - Tier B (chucks, showerheads): 99.97–99.99 %  
   - Tier C (EUV mirror blanks, gate tools): ≤70 % waste-derived until ≥2042 closed-loop  
3. No fab has ever reached 3 nm qualification in <46 months — TerraFab™ timeline moved accordingly  
4. ASML High-NA tools cannot be placed in third-party pods without ASML ownership — TerraFab™ restructured as ASML-partnered turnkey  
5. Realistic capex for a 30 k wspm 3 nm fab in 2034–2038 window: $9.2–11.4 B (not $2.8 B)

## Final Signed Validation Statement

> “Prompt 1a, as presented above, contains no violations of 2025 physics, supply-chain reality, building codes, SEMI standards, or U.S. export-control law.  
> All financial projections are conservative and bankable.  
> The Genesis-1 facility is fully financeable today.  
> The TerraFab™ vision is credible starting 2038 at 2–3 nodes per year once the eight corrections are applied.”
