## Purpose

This **Master Prompt Framework** consolidates all prior Genesis and TerraFab prompts into a single, modular structure. It is designed to generate detailed, self-consistent outputs covering:

- Regenerative closed-loop ecosystems  
- Advanced semiconductor and medical manufacturing  
- Integrated food, water, and energy systems  
- Modular 3D-printed infrastructure and kits  
- Compliance, sensor integration, and reporting  
- Phased national and global rollout  
- Financial, environmental, and operational modeling

## Framework Structure

### **Module 1: Genesis Hub Design**
**Goal:** Define closed-loop regenerative ecosystems.  
**Instructions:**
1. Specify footprint, layout, and area allocation (farms, housing, factories, biorefineries, energy, tourism, smart roads).  
2. Detail all outputs: food (staples, proteins, fruits, beverages), materials, ceramics, water, energy, textiles, electronics.  
3. Include fully integrated sensors for compliance and real-time monitoring.  
4. Incorporate modular ceramic tile envelope and snap-together kits.  
5. Provide water, energy, and carbon balance tables per hub.  
6. Include phased rollout plan: pilot, replication, national scaling, global adaptation.  
7. Optimize for **financial independence**, ESG, and zero-landfill operations.

### **Module 2: TerraFab Design**
**Goal:** Define advanced semiconductor and medical manufacturing facility.  
**Instructions:**
1. Co-locate TerraFab with Genesis hubs.  
2. Include semiconductor fabrication, wafer production, 3D-printed equipment, kilns/plasma units.  
3. Integrate biorefinery for API, OTC, and generic drug production.  
4. Map specialty crops from Genesis farms to medical output.  
5. Include full sensor network feeding **Compliance Portal** for FDA, EMA, CHIPS, IRA, and EPA reporting.  
6. Plan high-density solar deployment (180–220 W/m² over 1,200 ha) and DC microgrid integration.  
7. Provide phased rollout: pilot, expansion, replication, national scaling, global adaptation.  
8. Suggest strategic partnerships or acquisitions for refractory assets, API production, sensors.

### **Module 3: Modular Kits & 3D-Printed Infrastructure**
**Goal:** Standardize replication and automation.  
**Instructions:**
1. List all flat-pack kits required for Genesis + TerraFab.  
2. Include modular housing, hospital, school, farm, biorefinery, semiconductor line, and kiln/plasma units.  
3. Map feedstocks, energy, and water integration per kit.  
4. Include embedded sensors for compliance and monitoring.  
5. Ensure kits allow phased deployment and rapid replication.

### **Module 4: Smart City & Logistics Layer**
**Goal:** Integrate autonomous operations and residential services.  
**Instructions:**
1. Include luxury housing, hospitals, schools, hotels, tourism, and cultural hubs.  
2. Map DC microgrid, smart roads, and robotic delivery systems.  
3. Provide AI-driven distribution for energy, food, water, medical, and logistics.  
4. Integrate high-speed internet and edge computing networks.  
5. Include governance council, voting systems, and automation for resource allocation.

### **Module 5: Environmental, ESG & Sustainability**
**Goal:** Ensure closed-loop, carbon-negative operations.  
**Instructions:**
1. Calculate carbon balance, water balance, and material closure per hub and at scale.  
2. Include biochar, rewilding, renewable energy export, and circular economy metrics.  
3. Identify ESG credits, compliance incentives, and UN SDG alignment.  
4. Suggest mitigations for any standards not fully met.

### **Module 6: Financial Planning & Modeling**
**Goal:** Generate realistic multi-decade financial plans.  
**Instructions:**
1. Provide CAPEX, OPEX, revenue streams, payback, IRR, NPV, break-even for each hub and the network.  
2. Include phased revenue projections for Genesis + TerraFab (food, ceramics, semiconductors, APIs, sensors, tourism).  
3. Perform sensitivity analysis: energy prices, crop yields, semiconductor demand, regulatory delays.  
4. Include funding plan via self-replication and revenue streams; minimize reliance on grants.  

---

### **Module 7: National & Global Rollout**
**Goal:** Plan U.S. and international scaling.  
**Instructions:**
1. Map optimal hub locations (landfills, brownfields, bankrupt farms).  
2. Design logistics network for power, water, food, and medical distribution.  
3. Provide phased hub rollout schedule with replication strategy.  
4. Include global adaptation considerations: climate, regulations, feedstocks, compliance portals.

---

### **Module 8: Risk & Resilience Analysis**
**Goal:** Prepare for all contingencies.  
**Instructions:**
1. Identify risks: natural disasters, pandemics, supply-chain disruption, nuclear events.  
2. Provide mitigation: redundancy, autonomous operations, energy/water reserves, robotic operations.  
3. Include monitoring and alert protocols integrated into Compliance Portal.  

---

### **Module 9: Compliance & Sensor Network**
**Goal:** Ensure automated regulatory alignment.  
**Instructions:**
1. Map all sensor types per module: process, environmental, safety, product quality.  
2. Feed all sensors into centralized **Compliance Portal**.  
3. Generate automated dashboards and reporting for FDA, EPA, CHIPS, IRA, OSHA, and UN SDGs.  
4. Include fail-safes, redundancy, and data verification processes.
