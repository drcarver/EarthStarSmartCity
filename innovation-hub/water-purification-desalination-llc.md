## Objective

The **Water Purification & Desalination LLC** develops and operates advanced water generation, purification, and desalination systems that extend beyond basic [AWG Condensate Recovery](../../docs/energy-water-closure-systems.md) to achieve near-total water sovereignty in arid/coastal hubs and affiliates. It processes brine/mineral-rich outputs for value-added products, integrates with [Direct Air Capture LLC](../../innovation-hub/direct-air-capture-llc.md) for CO₂ mineralization, and closes water loops at 98–99% efficiency while generating revenue from excess potable water, mineral sales, and desalination services.

## Core Functions & Synergies

- **Advanced AWG Enhancement**: Tile-embedded + standalone units optimized for low-humidity/arid zones (40–70% of hub water).
- **Desalination (Coastal/Brackish)**: Reverse osmosis + forward osmosis hybrids powered by surplus biogas/BIPV; brine concentration for minerals.
- **Brine Valorization**: Extract lithium, magnesium, potassium, rare salts; residue for ceramic feedstock or enhanced weathering.
- **DAC Integration**: Use captured CO₂ for mineralization into aggregates (tiles/concrete) or bicarbonate recharge.
- **Wastewater Recycling**: Plasma/ozone/advanced oxidation for black/grey water → potable standard.
- **Synergies**:
  - [Energy Systems LLC](../../innovation-hub/energy-systems-llc.md): Surplus power for RO.
  - [Nutrient Cycling LLC](../../innovation-hub/nutrient-cycling-llc.md): Mineral byproducts as fertilizers.
  - [Restoration Kits LLC](../../innovation-hub/restoration-kits-llc.md): Recharge excess water to aquifers/wetlands.
  - [OceanNet LLC](../../innovation-hub/oceannet-llc.md): Coastal monitoring/data sharing.

## Manufacturing & Operations

- **Production**: Modular units from [Tile & Pipe Production Pod](../../components/pods/tile-pipe-production-pod.md) → permanent factories.
- **Inputs**: Waste-derived ceramics, surplus energy, brine/seawater.
- **Materials**: Toughened ceramic membranes, graphene-enhanced filters, piezo-powered pumps.
- **Automation**: Lights-out 80–95%; AI/digital twins optimize energy/water yield.

**Deployment**: Dense net (1/50–100 m² in water zones); digital twins predict maintenance; off-world extensions (Luna/Mars brine processing).

## Viability Enhancements & Bottleneck Reduction (Implemented)

1. **Brine-to-Mineral Focus**: Extract lithium/magnesium → high-margin sales (+$50–150M/hub/year); reduces desalination waste.
2. **DAC Synergy**: CO₂ + brine → marketable bicarbonates/aggregates (+$30–100M/hub/year credits).
3. **Coastal Affiliate Bundling**: Desal kits with [Restoration Kits](../../components/kits/restoration-blue-green-carbon-kits.md) for mangrove/oyster integration (+20–30% adoption in arid/coastal regions).
4. **AI Optimization**: Data moat for energy/water yield (+15–25% efficiency; bottleneck reduction via predictive desal cycles).
5. **Dual-Sourcing Membranes**: U.S./allied suppliers + internal ceramic production (+20% supply resilience).

Recomputed: CAPEX down 10–15% ($108–$162M/hub via synergies); revenues up 20–30% ($240–$520M/hub/year); IRR +5–10% (35–55%); viability uplift +10–15% (region-specific adaptations accelerate global licensing).
