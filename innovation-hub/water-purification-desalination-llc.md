# Water Purification & Desalination LLC

## Executive Overview

The Water Purification & Desalination LLC is a specialized entity within the Genesis Network Innovation Hub, focused on achieving 95–99% water closure through atmospheric water generation (AWG), digestate recovery, brine processing, and region-specific desalination. Launched in Phase 1 (2026–2027) with pilots on coastal/distressed sites, it internalizes water production for hubs, affiliates, and TerraWell FreeCare, while exporting surplus to recharge aquifers or sell to partners. Annual revenues scale to $100–400M/hub mature (water sales + credits); CAPEX $100–220M/hub (ROI <3 years via efficiencies).

## Viability & Integration Notes

The Water Purification & Desalination LLC enhances overall network viability by enabling full water independence in arid/coastal regions, reducing reliance on municipal supplies, and generating surplus for recharge/sales. Integration with smart airlocks (hyperspectral scanning for contaminants) ensures compliance with sustainable building codes (e.g., LEED, ISO/TC 268). All components align with smart city standards (IEEE 2030 for grid/water interoperability). Financials: Phase 1 CAPEX $100–220M/hub; revenues $100–400M/year mature (water sales + credits); ROI <3 years via efficiencies and synergies with Sustainable Energy LLC. Risks mitigated through modular kits and sensor-driven monitoring.
