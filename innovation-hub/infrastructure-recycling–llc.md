# Genesis Network: Infrastructure Recycling LLC

## Objective

**Infrastructure Recycling LLC** is the dedicated entity responsible for the systematic, profitable recycling of legacy infrastructure (roads, highways, dams, sewage systems, ports, buildings, vehicles, ships, e-waste) into high-value feedstocks for the Genesis Network. Primary outputs:

- Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA) for sustainable concrete bases
- Vitrified slag and processed metals for **[toughened ceramic tiles](components/tiles/ceramic-tiles.md)**
- Recovered critical materials (REEs, battery metals) for **[TerraFab](innovation-hub/terrafab-manufacturing-llc.md)** and **[Battery & Storage LLC](innovation-hub/battery-energy-storage-llc.md)**

The LLC operates mobile and fixed plasma/recycling facilities co-located with hubs, turning demolition waste into revenue while minimizing virgin mining and achieving near-100% material closure in mature phases.

## Core Functions & Operations

1. **Demolition & Collection**  
   - Mobile crusher fleets and plasma torch teams for on-site processing  
   - Partnerships with DOTs, municipalities, and private owners for waste streams  

2. **Primary Processing**  
   - Crushing → graded RCA  
   - Plasma vitrification → clean slag (tile feedstock) + syngas (energy) + metal ingots  

3. **Advanced Recovery**  
   - E-waste shredding + plasma refining for criticals  
   - Battery black mass processing → lithium/sodium precursors  

4. **Output Integration**  
   - RCA → hybrid concrete bases for **[smart roads](components/tiles/permeable-road-tiles.md)** and buildings  
   - Slag → **[tile factories](components/pods/tile-pipe-production-pod.md)**  
   - Metals → **[Advanced Fab LLC](innovation-hub/advanced-fab-llc.md)** and robotics  

5. **Site Remediation Tie-In**  
   - Post-demolition monitoring via **[dense sensor net](docs/sensors/dense-sensor-net-handbook.md)** for compliance credits  

## Manufacturing & Processing Technologies

- **Mobile Crusher Units**: Diesel-electric hybrids (transition to biogas) for concrete/asphalt → RCA  
- **Plasma Torch Systems**: High-temperature refining for complex wastes; co-produces syngas for **[Biogas Digester System](innovation-hub/energy-systems-llc.md)**  
- **Sensor-Integrated Sorting**: AI vision + radar for material separation  

All equipment built from Genesis ceramics where possible; waste heat captured for symbiosis.
