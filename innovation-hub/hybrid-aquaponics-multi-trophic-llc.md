# Hybrid Aquaponics & Multi-Trophic LLC  
**Specification Sheet**

**Mission & Overview**  
The Hybrid Aquaponics & Multi-Trophic LLC operates closed-loop, multi-species production systems combining fish, crustaceans, mollusks, insects (BSFL), and plants to achieve 95–99% resource closure while delivering high-value proteins, greens, and premium seafood. Core products include fresh tilapia/catfish/prawns, mussels, BSFL protein feed, and MyPlate-compliant vegetables/herbs. The LLC drives early cash flow (2026–2030) via premium produce and supports full network food security. Revenue role: 15–25% of hub total (~$150–600M/year mature per hub). Timeline: Pilots 2026–2028; full scale 2029–2035.

**Viability & Integration Notes**  
- High early revenue driver (greens/proteins premium sales).  
- 95–99% closure via multi-trophic layering reduces external inputs.  
- Dense sensor net + short-cycle testing (BSFL weekly) enables ruthless optimization.  
- Affiliate starter kits accelerate network growth.  
- Risk: Biosecurity (mitigated by airlocks + pathogen scanning).  
- Scalability: Pod replication + pre-supply from staging hubs.
