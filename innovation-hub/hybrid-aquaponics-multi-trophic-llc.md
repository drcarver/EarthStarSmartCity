## Overview

The **Hybrid Aquaponics & Multi-Trophic LLC** is one of the 19 independent limited liability companies within the Genesis Network's innovation hub. It is responsible for the design, optimization, production, and continuous improvement of **[hybrid aquaponics pods](components/pods/hybrid-aquaponics-pod.md)** and associated **[multi-trophic kits](components/kits/multi-trophic-aquaponics-kit.md)**. These systems integrate fish, crustaceans, mollusks, insects, and plants into highly efficient, closed-loop food production modules achieving 95–99% resource closure.

The LLC leverages the Network's **[data moat](docs/data-moat-digital-twin.md)** through parallel test tanks (50–500 variants per hub) and hyper-dense sensors to ruthlessly optimize yields, nutrient flows, and species interactions. Primary focus: high-value proteins (tilapia, prawns, crayfish, catfish, trout) with freshwater dominance and limited coastal saltwater pilots.

## Core Responsibilities

- Development and scaling of **[hybrid aquaponics pods](components/pods/hybrid-aquaponics-pod.md)** (freshwater primary; saltwater pilots)  
- Multi-trophic layering: Fish → crustaceans/mollusks → insects → plants  
- Integration of **[black soldier fly larvae (BSFL)](components/pods/bsfl-waste-conversion-pod.md)** and other insects for waste-to-feed conversion  
- Region-specific adaptations (e.g., cold-water trout in northern hubs, barramundi in coastal saltwater pilots)  
- Staggered production cycles for continuous harvest (weekly BSFL, monthly prawns, quarterly fish)  
- Revenue streams: Direct protein sales, insect feed to **[livestock pods](components/pods/large-animal-pod.md)**, premium seafood branding  
- Collaboration with **[microbial inoculant LLC](components/microbial-inoculant-biosolutions-llc.md)** for +10–30% yield boosts  

## Key Technologies & Integrations

- **Pods**: **[Standard aquaponics pod](components/pods/standard-aquaponics-pod.md)** (tilapia + prawns + BSFL + greens); **[premium protein pod](components/pods/premium-protein-pod.md)** (trout/crayfish); **[saltwater pilot pod](components/pods/saltwater-pilot-pod.md)** (barramundi/kelp)  
- **Tiles**: **[Roof glazing tiles](components/tiles/roof-glazing-semi-trans.md)** for natural light + BIPV; **[structural load-bearing tiles](components/tiles/structural-load-bearing.md)** for tanks  
- **Kits**: **[Multi-trophic aquaponics kit](components/kits/multi-trophic-aquaponics-kit.md)**; **[BSFL waste conversion kit](components/kits/bsfl-waste-conversion-kit.md)**  
- **Sensors**: Hyper-dense monitoring (see handbook below) integrated via **[compute tiles](components/tiles/compute-server-tile.md)**  
- **Automation**: Lights-out robotics from **[robotics LLC](components/robotics-automation-llc.md)**  

## Production & Revenue Model

- **Manufacturing**: All components produced in **[tile & pipe production pods](components/pods/tile-pipe-production-pod.md)** → permanent factories  
- **Inputs**: 70–95% waste-derived (slag, residues, RHA silica)  
- **Cost per Pod**: $0.8–$2.0M (mature)  
- **Revenue per Pod (mature)**: $650k–$2.1M/year (fish/protein dominant)  
- **Network-wide (mature, 20,000+ pods)**: $12–$45B/year
