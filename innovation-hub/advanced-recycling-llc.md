## Objective

**Advanced Recycling LLC** operates as a dedicated entity within the 32-LLC innovation hub structure, specializing in **plasma-based valorization** of complex waste streams (e-waste, end-of-life vehicles, industrial residues, sewage sludge) to recover critical materials while producing clean syngas and vitrified slag feedstock for [**toughened ceramic tiles**](../../components/tiles/ceramic-tiles.md). 

The LLC achieves:
- Near-100% material recovery from high-value waste
- Elimination of landfills through full valorization
- Revenue from recovered metals, syngas energy, and ceramic feedstock
- Integration with [**Infrastructure Recycling Kit**](../../components/kits/infrastructure-recycling-kit.md) and [**Mining & Recycling LLC**](../mining-recycling-llc.md)
- Compliance with circular economy standards and zero-waste goals

## Core Functions & Technologies

1. **Plasma Torch Processing**
   - High-temperature plasma gasification/vitrification (10,000–15,000°C)
   - Inputs: E-waste, batteries, EVs, sewage sludge, medical waste
   - Outputs: Metal ingots (REEs, lithium, cobalt, copper), syngas (H₂/CO for energy/fuels), vitrified slag (ceramic feedstock)

2. **Critical Materials Recovery**
   - Selective separation of rare earths, platinum group metals, lithium
   - Integration with [**Regenerative Pharmaceuticals LLC**](../regenerative-pharmaceuticals-llc.md) for trace recovery from medical waste

3. **Syngas Upgrading**
   - Cleaning + Fischer-Tropsch or methanation for fuels/energy
   - Feed to [**Industrial Gases LLC**](../industrial-gases-llc.md) or on-site power

4. **Mobile & Fixed Processing Units**
   - Trailer-mounted plasma units for on-site demolition/infrastructure recycling
   - Permanent plants co-located with hubs for volume processing

## Integration with Genesis Network

- **Waste Sources**: Construction demolition ([**Infrastructure Recycling LLC**](../infrastructure-recycling-llc.md)), sewage systems, brownfield remediation, end-of-life products from hubs.
- **Outputs to Network**:
  - Slag → [**Tile & Pipe Production Pod**](../../components/pods/tile-pipe-production-pod.md)
  - Metals → [**TerraFab Manufacturing LLC**](../terrafab-manufacturing-llc.md)
  - Syngas → [**Biogas Digester System**](../../docs/energy-water-closure-systems.md#2-biogas-digester-system)
- **Synergies**: Reduces virgin mining dependency; enables full circularity for electronics/appliances.

## Manufacturing & Operations

- **Units**: Mobile plasma torches (trailer-mounted) + fixed hub plants.
- **Process**: Shred/sort → plasma gasification → metal condensation → slag vitrification → syngas cleaning.
- **Inputs**: 70–95% from Network waste streams + external tipping (e-waste, sludge).
- **Materials**: Ceramic-lined reactors (self-produced tiles); plasma electrodes from recovered metals.

## Viability Enhancements & Bottleneck Reduction

- **Mobile Units**: Deploy to demolition sites → immediate revenue; reduces transport bottlenecks.
- **AI Optimization**: Data moat + plasma diagnostics → +20–30% recovery yields.
- **Dual-Sourcing**: Critical torch components stockpiled + recycled.
- **Integration**: Co-locate with infrastructure projects for tipping synergies.
- **Uplift**: +10–15% overall viability (closes mining loop; high margins accelerate self-funding).
