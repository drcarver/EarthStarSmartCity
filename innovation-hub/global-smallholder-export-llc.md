# Global Smallholder Export LLC  
**Specification Sheet – January 2026 Baseline**

## Executive Overview

The Global Smallholder Export LLC is a dedicated entity within the Genesis Network Innovation Hub responsible for licensing, adapting, and exporting scalable regenerative kits, pods, and technologies to smallholder farmers and co-ops worldwide. Focusing on sovereign, culturally compliant implementations, it handles region-specific customizations (e.g., halal/kosher processing, indigenous protocols) while generating revenue through kit sales, licensing fees, and revenue-sharing on premium produce/carbon credits. Launched in Phase 3 (2030–2035), it drives global expansion post-Fortress West maturity, with projected annual revenue of $20–80B by 2050 from exports and partnerships.
