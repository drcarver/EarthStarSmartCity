# Genesis Network: **Forestry LLC**

## Objective

The **Forestry LLC** manages sustainable, lights-out forestry operations within the Genesis Network, producing timber, biomass, and carbon credits while minimizing environmental impact. It integrates with **[Nutrient Cycling LLC](innovation-hub/nutrient-cycling-llc.md)** (waste-to-biochar), **[Restoration Kits LLC](innovation-hub/restoration-kits-llc.md)** (reforestation), and **[Vertical Urban Farming LLC](innovation-hub/vertical-urban-farming-llc.md)** (agroforestry synergies) to create a fully circular, regenerative forestry system.

## Key Functions & Synergies

- **Lights-Out Harvesting**: Autonomous drones, harvesters, and forwarders for selective logging with minimal soil disturbance.
- **Reforestation**: AI-optimized planting using **[Restoration (Blue-Green Carbon) Kit](components/kits/restoration-blue-green-carbon-kit.md)** and microbial inoculants from **[Microbial Inoculant Production Kit](components/kits/microbial-inoculant-production-kit.md)**.
- **Biomass Processing**: Waste wood → biochar (via **[Biochar & Soil Amendment Kit](components/kits/biochar-soil-amendment-kit.md)**) → soil enhancement and credits.
- **Synergies**: Timber/fuel to **[High-Speed Rail LLC](innovation-hub/high-speed-rail-transport-llc.md)** and **[Autonomous Mobility LLC](innovation-hub/autonomous-mobility-llc.md)**; carbon sequestration feeds **[Nutrient Cycling LLC](innovation-hub/nutrient-cycling-llc.md)**; agroforestry buffers in **[Productive Core](docs/regenerative-city-layout.md)**.

## Manufacturing & Operations

- **Location**: Managed from hub-based operations centers; equipment built via **[Robotics & Automation LLC](innovation-hub/robotics-automation-llc.md)** and **[TerraFab Manufacturing LLC](innovation-hub/terrafab-manufacturing-llc.md)**.
- **Inputs**: 70–95% waste-derived (ceramic tools, recycled steel components, bio-lubricants from **[Bio-Materials & Textiles LLC](innovation-hub/bio-materials-textiles-llc.md)**).
- **Materials**: Ceramic blades/tools (durable, low-maintenance); autonomous harvesters with **[RTK GNSS Anchor Tile](components/tiles/rtk-gnss-anchor-tile.md)** precision.
- **Process**: AI planning → drone scouting → selective autonomous harvesting → on-site processing → biochar production → reforestation.
- **New Kit**: Forestry Automation Kit (drones, harvesters, planting bots; $200k–$400k cost, $400k–$800k selling).

## Recomputed Costs & Revenues (per Mature Hub, February 2026 Baseline)

- **CAPEX**: $80–$200M (autonomous fleet, processing; down 10–15% via Tesla robotics synergies and waste-derived tools).
- **OPEX**: 20–35% of revenue (maintenance, energy; reduced via lights-out automation).
- **Equipment Costs**: Autonomous harvesters $500k–$1M/unit; planting drones $50k–$100k/unit.
- **Annual Revenue**: $150–$450M (timber 40%, biochar/credits 30%, biomass/fuel 20%, eco-tourism 10%; margins 60–80%).
- **Revenue Uplift from Enhancements**: +10–20% ($15–$90M/year) via AI optimization (yield +15–25%) and carbon credits ($150–$250/tCO₂e).
- **IRR Contribution**: +6–10% to network (overall 35–50%).
- **Timeline**: Pilots 2028–2030; mature operations 2031–2035 (accelerated 6 months via **[Data Moat](docs/data-moat.md)** iterations).

## Detailed Sensor Handbook for Forestry Operations

Sensors embedded in drones, harvesters, and forest tiles; support precision forestry, compliance, and carbon credit verification.

| Sensor Type                  | Description & Function | Integration & Standards | Input/Materials | Prod Cost ($/unit) | Revenue Impact |
|------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Multispectral Camera         | Vegetation health, species ID, stress detection | Drone-mounted; IEEE 1451 | Mini-Fab optics + ceramic | 100–200 | Yield optimization +$50–$150M/hub/year |
| LiDAR (Terrain Mapping)      | 3D forest structure, canopy density | Drone/harvester; ISO/TC 268 | Electronics + ceramic | 200–400 | Precision planning +$40–$120M/hub/year |
| Soil Moisture/Nutrient       | Ground health monitoring for reforestation | Ground tiles; ISO 14001 | Waste-derived | 20–50 | Carbon credit accuracy +$30–$80M/hub/year |
| Acoustic (Wildlife/Equipment) | Biodiversity monitoring, machinery health | Drone embeds; ITU-T Y.4900 | Ceramic + microphones | 30–60 | Eco-tourism/credits +$20–$60M/hub/year |
| RTK GNSS Receiver            | Centimeter-level positioning for planting/harvesting | **[RTK GNSS Anchor Tile](components/tiles/rtk-gnss-anchor-tile.md)** + drone | Ceramic + antenna | 38–85 | Accuracy +$50–$150M/hub/year |

**Handbook Notes**: All sensors waste-derived where possible; Faraday mesh for EMP; AI/data moat for predictive alerts. Viability +10–20% (reduced downtime 20–30%); off-world extensible (radiation-hardened variants).
