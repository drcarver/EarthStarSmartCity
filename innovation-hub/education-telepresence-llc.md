# Education & Telepresence LLC

The **Education & Telepresence LLC** operates as an independent entity within the Genesis Network innovation hub, delivering free, world-class education and training to residents, workers, affiliates, and global smallholders. It leverages **VR/AR telepresence**, **digital twins**, and the gamified **Genesis Dojo** platform to accelerate workforce development, reduce operational errors, and foster regenerative culture.

## Mission & Objectives

- Provide free K-12, vocational, and lifelong competency training aligned with **regenerative principles**.  
- Eliminate human capital bottlenecks in scaling hubs and affiliates.  
- Use **data moat** feedback to continuously evolve curriculum quarterly.  
- Support **TerraWell FreeCare** health literacy modules and community governance training.
