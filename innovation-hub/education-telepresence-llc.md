# Education & Telepresence LLC  
**Detailed Specification – January 2026 Baseline**

The Education & Telepresence LLC is a core component of the Genesis Network Innovation Hub, delivering free, world-class, competency-based education and training via VR/AR telepresence, digital twins, and AI tutors. It spans K-12, vocational, and lifelong learning, focusing on regenerative skills, with seamless integration into housing, schools, and community pods. Deployed in Phase 1 (2026–2027) for bootstrap training, it scales to support network-wide workforce development, attracting residents and accelerating hub replication.
