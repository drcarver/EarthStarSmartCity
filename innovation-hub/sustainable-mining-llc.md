## Objective

The **Sustainable Mining LLC** oversees all mineral and critical material acquisition for the Genesis Network with the explicit goal of minimizing virgin extraction to <10–20% of current global mining levels by 2050. It prioritizes:

- Aggressive recycling of existing infrastructure and e-waste
- Plasma torch processing for low-grade ores, black mass, and slag
- Co-location with hubs for closed-loop integration
- Sodium-ion batteries and ceramics to eliminate most lithium, cobalt, and nickel mining
- Verifiable compliance with sustainable mining standards and carbon/biodiversity credits

This LLC replaces traditional mining with a circular economy model, feeding recovered materials directly into **[TerraFab Manufacturing LLC](innovation-hub/terrafab-manufacturing-llc.md)** and **[Bio-Materials & Textiles LLC](innovation-hub/bio-materials-textiles-llc.md)**.

## Key Functions & Synergies

- **Recycling & Urban Mining**: Process end-of-life vehicles, ships, buildings, roads, and e-waste via mobile plasma torches → raw ingots + vitrified slag (ceramic feedstock).
- **Plasma Processing**: Smelt low-grade ores, recover rare earths, and refine battery black mass; produce syngas for **[Hydrogen Production LLC](innovation-hub/hydrogen-production-llc.md)** backup.
- **Critical Materials Recovery**: Focus on remaining needs (e.g., REEs, select battery elements) from brine (sodium-ion) and recycled sources.
- **Synergies**: Waste from **[Infrastructure Recycling LLC](innovation-hub/infrastructure-recycling-llc.md)** and **[Advanced Recycling LLC](innovation-hub/advanced-recycling-llc.md)** feeds plasma; outputs to **[Battery & Storage LLC](innovation-hub/battery-storage-llc.md)** and **[Mining & Recycling LLC](innovation-hub/mining-recycling-llc.md)**; monitoring via **[Dense Sensor Net Kit](components/kits/dense-sensor-net-kit.md)** and **[RTK GNSS Anchor Tile](components/tiles/rtk-gnss-anchor-tile.md)** for compliance.

## Mining Strategy & Practices

- **Primary Mining**: <10–20% of current levels by 2050; only criticals not recyclable at scale (REEs, trace elements).
- **Modernization**: Buy existing mines → lights-out automation + plasma processing; co-locate with hubs for energy/water symbiosis.
- **Sodium-Ion Priority**: Eliminates most lithium/cobalt/nickel mining; brine-sourced sodium abundant.
- **Standards Compliance**: ISO 14001, IRMA (Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance), blockchain-verified traceability for credits.
- **Reclamation**: All sites rewilded post-extraction using **[Restoration (Blue-Green Carbon) Kit](components/kits/restoration-blue-green-carbon-kit.md)**; sensors track soil/water recovery.

## Manufacturing & Infrastructure Integration

- **Plasma Torch Units**: Mobile/co-located; ceramic housings from **[Tile & Pipe Production Pod](components/pods/tile-pipe-production-pod.md)**.
- **Processing**: Ore → ingots + slag (ceramic); black mass → metals + gases.
- **Transport**: **[Tesla Semi](innovation-hub/autonomous-mobility-llc.md)** for bulk; **hyperloop pod system** when available.
- **Monitoring**: Ground-based radar + **[Dense Sensor Net Kit](components/kits/dense-sensor-net-kit.md)** for environmental compliance; data feeds **[OS & Software LLC](innovation-hub/os-software-llc.md)**.

## Recomputed Costs & Revenues (per Mature Hub, February 2026 Baseline)

- **CAPEX**: $80–$180M (plasma units, automation; down 15–20% via recycling synergies).
- **OPEX**: 20–30% of revenue (automation + closure efficiencies).
- **Processing Costs**: $50–$150/ton ore; $100–$300/ton black mass.
- **Revenue Streams**:
  - Recovered metals/REEs: $200–$500M/year (internal use 40%, external sales 60%).
  - Slag/ceramic feedstock: $100–$250M/year.
  - Carbon/biodiversity credits: $50–$150M/year ($150–$250/tCO₂e equivalent).
- **Annual Revenue**: $350–$900M (margins 60–80%).
- **Revenue Uplift**: +10–20% ($35–$180M/year) from AI optimization and credits platform.
- **IRR Contribution**: +6–10% to network (overall 35–50%).
- **Timeline**: Pilots 2028–2030; mature operations 2031–2035.
