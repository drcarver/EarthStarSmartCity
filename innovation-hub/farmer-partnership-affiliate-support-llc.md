# Farmer Partnership & Affiliate Support LLC  
**Executive Overview**  

The Farmer Partnership & Affiliate Support LLC empowers small family farmers and global smallholders with low/zero-interest bridge loans, free expertise/training, subsidized starter kits, lease-to-own robotics, and market access to transition to regenerative Genesis methods. This hybrid co-op/LLC model preserves independence while integrating affiliates into the Network for bidirectional resource sharing, premium branding, and revenue-sharing. Projected scale: 10,000–50,000 U.S. partners by 2040s; primary vector for global smallholder adoption. Phase: Early Scale (2028–2035 onward). Financials: Annual revenue $200–600M/hub from kit sales/upgrades (60–80% margins), revenue-share (5–15%), and excess power/water sales; CAPEX $50–150M/hub for program infrastructure; IRR contribution +8–12%.
