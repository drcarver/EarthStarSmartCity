## 1. Mission & Role in the Genesis Network

The **DAC & Enhanced Weathering LLC** develops, deploys, and scales **Direct Air Capture** (**DAC**) systems and **Enhanced Weathering** techniques to achieve gigaton-scale carbon removal. It operates as a specialized LLC within the **Genesis Network Innovation Hub**, focusing on:
- Modular DAC pilots using waste-derived ceramic membranes  
- Enhanced weathering via spreading crushed basalt/olivine on agricultural lands  
- Integration with **Genesis** hubs for energy (surplus biogas/solar), water (AWG/digestate), and monitoring (**hyper-dense sensor nets**)  
- Revenue from premium **carbon credits** ($150–250/tCO₂e) and co-benefits (soil health, biodiversity)

**DAC** captures CO₂ from ambient air using ceramic-based sorbents; **Enhanced Weathering** accelerates natural mineral carbonation in soils.

## 2. Core Technologies & Integration

- **DAC System**: Ceramic membrane modules (waste silica-derived) + low-temperature regeneration using hub waste heat  
- **Enhanced Weathering**: Basalt/olivine sourced from recycled aggregates; spread via drones/robots on **agroforestry** zones  
- **Energy/Water**: Surplus from **BIPV tiles**, **biogas microturbines**; water from **AWG**  
- **Monitoring**: **Hyper-dense sensor nets** (pH, CO₂ flux, soil moisture, microbial activity)  
- **Outputs**: CO₂ mineralization into aggregates/tiles; soil enhancement (+10–30% yields via microbial synergies)  

**Feedback Loop**: DAC data refines **digital twins** → optimizes **Earth** hubs → informs **lunar/Mars** closed-loop designs.
