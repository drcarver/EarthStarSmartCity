# Automated Biorefinery & Processing LLC – Detailed Specification

The Automated Biorefinery & Processing LLC develops and operates lights-out biorefineries for waste valorization and value-added food processing in the Genesis Network. Its mission is to achieve 95–99% material closure by converting farm wastes, digestate, and external streams (C&D, ELFM, sewage) into biogas, biochar, industrial gases, and processed goods (bread, beer, meats, sweets, dairy). Launching in Phase 2 (2028–2029), it reaches maturity by 2032–2035, contributing $200–600M/hub/year in revenues from byproducts, gases, and premium processed foods—playing a key role in network self-funding and circular economy acceleration.
