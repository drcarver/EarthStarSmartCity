# Automated Biorefinery & Processing LLC

**Executive Overview**  
The Automated Biorefinery & Processing LLC operates modular, lights-out facilities that convert organic and inorganic waste streams (manure, food scraps, crop residues, C&D slag, ELFM slag) into high-value products: biogas, biochar, syngas, microbial inoculants, bio-materials, and processed foods/beverages. It achieves 95–99% material closure using plasma vitrification, anaerobic digestion, and enzymatic breakdown. Core mission is to close nutrient and energy loops across the Genesis Network while generating revenue through tipping fees, biogas sales, biochar credits, and value-added food/beverage outputs. Timeline: pilots 2027–2029, full scale 2030–2035. Revenue role: 10–15% of mature hub income ($150–450M/year/hub), with 65–85% margins.

**Project Phase**: Pilots 2027–2029; full scale 2030–2035; mature contribution 10–15% of hub revenue.

**Viability & Integration Notes**  
- High integration with aquaponics/livestock (waste → biogas → digestate → inoculants → soil/food loop).  
- Revenue stability via tipping fees + internal sales + credits.  
- Bottleneck risk (feedstock variability) mitigated by parallel testing & sensor-driven optimization.  
- Strong viability (8.5/10) due to modularity, high margins, and essential role in closure.
