# Robotics & Automation LLC

**Objective**: The Robotics & Automation LLC develops and deploys autonomous systems for farming, manufacturing, delivery, and mobility (e.g., **swarm bots**, robotaxis, harvesters) to achieve 80–95% lights-out operation in hubs by 2035. All robotics are constructed using **tiles**, ceramics, and kits from the **Tile & Pipe Production Pod**; mandatory **smart airlocks** in all related buildings scan for weapons/explosives and alert security via **dense sensor nets**. Complies with smart city standards (ISO/TC 268, IEEE 2030, ITU-T Y.4900, Matter/Thread) and sustainable building codes (ISO 14001, Cradle-to-Cradle). Suggested file path: innovation-hub/robotics-automation-llc.md.

## Integration with Genesis Ecosystem

- **Manufacturing**: Assembled in dedicated pods using **smart furniture surface tiles** for frames, **energy storage tiles** for batteries, **RTK GNSS anchor tiles** for navigation ([components/tiles/rtk-gnss-anchor-tile.md]).
- **Input Sources**: 70–95% waste-derived (C&D slag for ceramics, recycled metals from **infrastructure recycling kit** ([components/kits/infrastructure-recycling-kit.md]), farm residues for composites).
- **Materials**: Toughened ceramics (60–100+ MPa) + embeds (RISC-V compute from **TerraFab Manufacturing LLC** ([innovation-hub/terrafab-manufacturing-llc.md]), sensors from **dense sensor net kit** ([components/kits/dense-sensor-net-kit.md])).
