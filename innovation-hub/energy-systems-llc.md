# Genesis Network: Energy Systems LLC

## Objective

**Energy Systems LLC** is responsible for delivering near-complete energy independence across all Genesis hubs, affiliates, and regenerative cities through integrated, waste-derived, modular systems. The LLC focuses on:

- Primary generation (**BIPV Glazing & Roof Tiles**, biogas microturbines)  
- Supplementary harvesting (piezoelectric floors/roads, waste heat recovery)  
- Distributed storage (sodium-ion tiles/pods, phase-change thermal buffering)  
- Smart microgrid orchestration and surplus export  

All systems are manufactured in **[Tile & Pipe Production Pod](../components/pods/tile-pipe-production-pod.md)** → permanent tile factories, using 70–95% waste-derived inputs. The LLC operates with full risk isolation while feeding surplus power to other LLCs (e.g., **[TerraFab Manufacturing LLC](terrafab-manufacturing-llc.md)**, **[Robotics & Automation LLC](robotics-automation-llc.md)**).
