## Objective

The **Regenerative Hubs LLC** oversees the development, operation, and scaling of Genesis regenerative hubs (500–2,500 ha sites), transforming degraded lands into net-positive ecosystems that produce food, energy, water, materials, and services with 95–99% resource closure. It coordinates **[pods](components/pods/)**, **[tiles](components/tiles/)**, and **[kits](components/kits/)** to achieve self-replication, farmer empowerment, and integration with **[TerraWell FreeCare LLC](terrawell-freecare-support-llc.md)** and **[Smallholder Partnership Co-op LLC](farmer-partnership-affiliate-support-llc.md)**.

## Key Functions & Synergies

- **Hub Development**: Site selection (brownfields/landfills), remediation via **[ELFM pods](components/pods/elfm-pod.md)**, layout per **[Regenerative City & Hub Layout Principles](docs/regenerative-city-hub-layout-principles.md)**.
- **Closed-Loop Operations**: Food from **[Aquaponics Pod](components/pods/aquaponics-pod.md)** and **[Livestock Pod](components/pods/livestock-pod.md)**; energy via **[BIPV Glazing & Roof Tiles](components/tiles/roof-glazing-bipv.md)** and **[Biogas Digester System](components/pods/biogas-digester-pod.md)**; water from **[AWG & Condensate Recovery](components/pods/awg-condensate-recovery-pod.md)**.
- **Synergies**: Supplies **[TerraFab Manufacturing LLC](innovation-hub/terrafab-manufacturing-llc.md)** with materials; integrates **[Smart Airlock Kit](components/kits/smart-airlock-kit.md)** in all buildings for security; uses **[Dense Sensor Net Kit](components/kits/dense-sensor-net-kit.md)** for monitoring.

## Operations & Infrastructure

- **Manufacturing**: All components from **[Tile & Pipe Production Pod](components/pods/tile-pipe-production-pod.md)**; waste-derived ceramics for structures.
- **Smart Airlocks**: Mandatory in **all buildings** (mmWave/hyperspectral + trace detectors for weapons/explosives; alerts via **[OS & Software LLC](innovation-hub/os-software-llc.md)**).
- **Standards**: Aligns with **[ISO/TC 268](docs/standards/iso-tc-268-smart-cities.md)** (smart city), **[ISO 14001](docs/standards/iso-14001-environmental.md)** (sustainable), IEEE 2030 (grid), ITU-T Y.4900 (IoT).
- **Resilience**: 90+ day isolation; mobile pods for relocation.

## Recomputed Costs & Revenues (per Mature Hub, February 2026 Baseline)

- **CAPEX**: $200–$500M (site remediation $50–$100M, pods/kits $150–$400M; down 10–15% via waste synergies).
- **OPEX**: 20–30% of revenue (automation + closure).
- **Annual Revenue**: $1,800–$4,000M (food 40%, energy 20%, materials 20%, services/credits 20%; margins 60–80%).
- **Revenue Uplift**: +15–25% ($270–$1,000M/year) from microbial boosts and credits ($150–$250/tCO₂e).
- **IRR Contribution**: +15–20% to network (overall 35–50%).
- **Timeline**: Bootstrap 2027–2030; maturity 2031–2035.
