# Lights-Out Sustainable Forestry LLC  
**Detailed Specification – January 2026 Baseline**

The Lights-Out Sustainable Forestry LLC is a specialized entity within the Genesis Network's Innovation Hub, focusing on AI-driven, automated selective logging, reforestation, and waste valorization to biochar. It leverages robotics, sensor networks, and regenerative practices to achieve sustainable timber production, biodiversity enhancement, and carbon sequestration while minimizing human intervention and environmental impact. Deployment begins in Phase 2 (2027–2029) for pilots, scaling in Phase 3 (2030–2035) with projected revenues of $150–450M/year per hub from timber, biochar sales, and credits.

**Project Phase**: Phase 2 (2027–2029) pilots; Phase 3 (2030–2035) scale-up.

**Financials**: CAPEX $80–200M/hub (phased 2030s); OPEX $20–50M/year; Revenue $150–450M/year (timber $80–250M, biochar/credits $50–150M, kits $20–50M); IRR +10–15% contribution; Break-even 2–4 years.

## Viability & Integration Notes

This LLC enhances network viability by providing sustainable timber/biochar while minimizing mining through waste recycling. Integration with robotics and sensors ensures 80–95% lights-out operation; co-location with hubs reduces logistics. Key risk: Regulatory certification delays mitigated by standards portal. Supports overall sequestration goals (+20–40% via forests).
