## Objective

The **Lights-Out Sustainable Forestry LLC** develops and operates fully automated, lights-out sustainable forestry systems that produce timber, biomass, and ecosystem services with zero human presence on-site during normal operations. It replaces traditional logging with AI, robotics, and regenerative practices to achieve net-positive carbon sequestration, biodiversity enhancement, and high-quality lumber supply for the Network's ceramic-hybrid construction and **[Bio-Materials & Textiles LLC](innovation-hub/bio-materials-textiles-llc.md)**.

## Key Functions & Synergies

- **Sustainable Timber Production**: Selective harvesting of mature trees using autonomous systems; replanting with native, high-sequestration species.
- **Biomass & Biochar**: Harvest residues processed into biochar via **[Biochar & Soil Amendment Kit](components/kits/biochar-soil-amendment-kit.md)** for soil enhancement.
- **Ecosystem Services**: Maintain biodiversity corridors, carbon sinks, and water retention; generate credits.
- **Synergies**: Supplies wood to **[Furniture Production Kit](components/kits/furniture-production-kit.md)** and **[High-Speed Rail LLC](innovation-hub/high-speed-rail-llc.md)**; biochar to **[Nutrient Cycling LLC](innovation-hub/nutrient-cycling-llc.md)**; data to **[OS & Software LLC](innovation-hub/os-software-llc.md)** for optimization.

## Core Technologies & Operations

- **Autonomy**: Lights-out operation via **[Robotics & Automation LLC](innovation-hub/robotics-automation-llc.md)** drones/swarm harvesters; vision-only navigation (Tesla-inspired) + **[RTK GNSS Anchor Tile](components/tiles/rtk-gnss-anchor-tile.md)** for precision.
- **Harvesting**: Autonomous selective cutting (laser-guided saws); residue collection for biochar.
- **Replanting**: Drone seeding/planting; microbial inoculants from **[Microbial Inoculant Production Kit](components/kits/microbial-inoculant-production-kit.md)** for rapid establishment.
- **Monitoring**: Dense sensor net (ground radar, Starlink nodes) for health, carbon flux, biodiversity; digital twins predict optimal harvest/replant cycles.
- **Power**: On-site BIPV + piezo + **[Energy Storage Starter Kit](components/kits/energy-storage-starter-kit.md)** sodium-ion batteries; biogas backup from local residues.
- **Security**: **[Smart Airlock Kit](components/kits/smart-airlock-kit.md)** at access points; perimeter **[Basic Security & Monitoring Tile](components/tiles/basic-security-monitoring-tile.md)**.

## Manufacturing & Infrastructure Integration

- **Equipment**: Autonomous harvesters, drones, and processors manufactured in **[TerraFab Manufacturing LLC](innovation-hub/terrafab-manufacturing-llc.md)** using waste-derived ceramics.
- **Roads**: **[Permeable Road / Path Tile](components/tiles/permeable-road-path-tile.md)** for internal access; inductive charging for electric equipment.
- **Standards Compliance**: ISO 14001 (sustainable forestry), FSC certification, smart city integration (ISO/TC 268).

## Recomputed Costs & Revenues (per Mature Forestry Zone, February 2026 Baseline)

- **CAPEX**: $80–$200M (autonomous equipment, sensors, roads; down 10–15% via Tesla-inspired vision-only systems).
- **OPEX**: 15–25% of revenue (automation reduces labor to near-zero).
- **Annual Revenue**: $150–$450M (timber $100–$250M, biochar/credits $30–$100M, biomass $20–$100M; margins 65–85%).
- **Revenue Uplift**: +15–25% ($22–$112M/year) from AI optimization (yield +20–30%) and credits ($150–$250/tCO₂e).
- **IRR Contribution**: +6–10% to network (overall 35–50%).
- **Timeline**: Pilots 2028–2030; mature operations 2031–2035 (accelerated 6 months via **[Data Moat](docs/data-moat.md)** and robotics).
