## Objective

**Water Sovereignty LLC** is the dedicated entity responsible for achieving and maintaining **95–99% water closure** across all Genesis hubs, mini-hubs, affiliates, regenerative cities, and future off-world extensions. It designs, manufactures, deploys, and operates systems for atmospheric water generation (**AWG**), condensate recovery, stormwater capture, distributed storage, purification, and recirculation — ensuring complete independence from municipal supplies while generating surplus for aquifer recharge, export, or humanitarian use.

The LLC integrates tightly with **Energy Systems LLC** (for power), **Infrastructure & Circulation LLC** (for pipes/roads), **Productive Core** zones (for ag irrigation), and **TerraWell FreeCare LLC** (for potable standards). It operates as a profit center through internal transfers, affiliate kit sales, excess water credits, and external contracts (e.g., drought-prone regions, disaster response).

## Core Systems & Components

Water Sovereignty LLC manages six primary systems, all manufactured in **Tile & Pipe Production Pods** → permanent factories using 70–95% waste-derived inputs.
