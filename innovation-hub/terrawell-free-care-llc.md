## Executive Summary

**TerraWell FreeCare** is a standalone 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation operated by the **TerraWell Foundation**, completely separate from EarthStar Technologies and the **Genesis System**. It delivers **100% free** primary/urgent medical care, basic mental health services, food, OTC medications, select generic prescriptions, durable medical equipment (wheelchairs, walkers, crutches, CPAP accessories, basic orthotics/prosthetics), and health literacy training to any person presenting—no ID, insurance, means test, co-pay, or appointment required.

**Mission**: Provide universal, barrier-free humanitarian care using only fair-market-value donations of qualifying tangible inventory from EarthStar Technologies (no public funds, services, or cash accepted).

- 55–135 million medical encounters
