## 1. Overview & Mission

The **Industrial Gases (ASU/Rare) LLC** operates as one of the 19 specialized entities in the Genesis Network Innovation Hub. Its mission is to produce high-purity industrial gases (LOX, LIN, LAR) via **Air Separation Units** (ASUs) and retrofit systems for rare gases (neon, krypton, xenon, helium-3 where feasible), supporting internal Network needs (welding, cryogenics, medical, manufacturing) and generating external revenue through sales and licensing.

- **Primary Outputs**: Liquid oxygen (LOX), nitrogen (LIN), argon (LAR); rare gases for semiconductors/lighting  
- **Integration**: Gases power plasma torches, biorefineries, TerraFab; surplus sold to affiliates/markets  
- **Sustainability**: Waste-derived ceramic components; energy from biogas/BIPV; CO₂ capture tie-in  

## 2. Technology & Manufacturing

### Core Technologies
- **Cryogenic ASUs**: Distillation columns for air separation (N₂ 78%, O₂ 21%, Ar 0.93%)  
- **Rare Gas Retrofits**: Membrane/PSA + cryogenic enrichment for neon/krypton/xenon  
- **Materials**: 70–95% waste-derived toughened ceramics (slag/RHA) for vessels/insulation  
- **Automation**: 80–95% lights-out; edge RISC-V control; predictive maintenance via sensor net  

### Manufacturing Process
- **Inputs**: Ambient air (compressor intake); waste-derived ceramics from tile factories  
- **Process**: Compression → cooling → distillation → liquefaction → storage  
- **Facilities**: Modular ASU pods (40 ft high-cube) → clustered permanent plants  
- **Cost Breakdown**: Pod CAPEX $1.2–$3.5M; mature plant $50–150M  
- **Revenue Model**: Internal use (zero-cost); external sales $0.5–$2/kg (LOX/LIN); rare gases $500–$5,000/m³  

## 3. Integration & Standards Compliance

- **Network Tie-Ins**: Gases feed plasma vitrification, biorefinery cooling, medical (TerraWell), semiconductor (TerraFab)  
- **Smart City Standards**: ISO/TC 268, IEEE 2030, ITU-T Y.4900, Matter/Thread  
- **Sustainable Codes**: ISO 14001, Cradle-to-Cradle; zero-emission operation via biogas  
- **Security**: Faraday mesh vessels; capability-based microkernel controls
