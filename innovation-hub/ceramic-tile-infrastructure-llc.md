# Ceramic Tile & Infrastructure LLC  
**Detailed Specification – January 2026 Baseline**

The Ceramic Tile & Infrastructure LLC is responsible for producing the foundational toughened ceramic tiles and smart infrastructure components that enable the Genesis Network's regenerative, modular architecture. Its mission is to manufacture waste-derived tiles with embedded smart features (BIPV, AWG, piezo, sensors) for structural, cladding, and infrastructure applications, achieving 70–95% waste utilization and self-powered functionality. Core products include load-bearing tiles, smart roads/pipes, and related kits; services encompass custom infrastructure upgrades. Timeline: Operational from 2027 (pilot factories); mature scale by 2035 (500–1,000 sites). Revenue role: Generates $43–$140B/year network-wide by 2040s through tile sales, infrastructure contracts, and kit licensing (58–85% margins).
