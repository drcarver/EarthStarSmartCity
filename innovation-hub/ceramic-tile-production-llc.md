# Ceramic Tile Production LLC

The Ceramic Tile Production LLC is a foundational entity in the Genesis Network Innovation Hub, specializing in the mass production of multi-functional, waste-derived toughened ceramic tiles that serve as the primary building blocks for regenerative structures, infrastructure, and smart systems. Manufactured in dedicated pods and factories using 70–95% recycled inputs, these tiles integrate active features like BIPV, AWG, piezoelectric harvesting, sensors, and water bladders, enabling self-powered, resilient, and intelligent construction. Operating in Phase 1 (2027–2028), this LLC generates early revenues through tile sales ($12–35B/year network-wide by 2035) with production costs $1.6–5.0/ft² and selling prices $4.8–14.0/ft², achieving 65–82% margins.
