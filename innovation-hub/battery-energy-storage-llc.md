## Overview

The **Battery & Energy Storage LLC** is a core component of the **[Innovation Hub](innovation-hub-overview.md)**, focused on developing and manufacturing **sodium-ion batteries** using waste-derived materials (primarily slag, ash, and brine byproducts from **[plasma vitrification](../components/pods/plasma-vitrification-pod.md)** and **[biorefinery](../components/pods/biorefinery-pod.md)** operations). 

This LLC enables **DC-dominant microgrids** across **[Genesis Hubs](../strategy/genesis-hub-overview.md)**, providing resilient, long-duration energy storage with minimal reliance on scarce critical minerals (lithium, cobalt, nickel). Production is fully integrated into **[TerraFab](terrafab-overview.md)** facilities using **[ceramic tile production](../components/tiles/ceramic-tile-production.md)** waste streams.

**Key Advantages**  
- **Abundant raw materials** – Sodium from brine/seawater, hard carbon anodes from farm waste biochar  
- **Closed-loop** – Battery recycling via plasma → feedstock for new cells + ceramic slag  
- **High resilience** – Non-flammable, wide temperature tolerance (-20°C to +60°C), 8,000–15,000 cycle life  
- **DC-native** – Eliminates inversion losses in **[smart grid](../components/kits/smart-infrastructure-kit.md)**

## Technology & Specifications

- **Cell Chemistry**: Prussian blue cathode + hard carbon anode (waste-derived biochar)  
- **Energy Density**: 120–180 Wh/kg (mature 2040s: 200–280 Wh/kg)  
- **Cycle Life**: 8,000–15,000 cycles at 80% capacity retention  
- **Safety**: Aqueous/non-flammable electrolyte variants prioritized  
- **Form Factors**: Modular ceramic-housed packs (integrated into **[structural tiles](../components/tiles/structural-load-bearing-tile.md)** or standalone pods)  
- **Integration**: Direct DC coupling to **[BIPV roof glazing](../components/tiles/roof-glazing-tile.md)**, **[piezo roads](../components/tiles/permeable-road-tile.md)**, and **[biogas microturbines](../components/pods/biogas-digester-pod.md)**  

**Production Process**  
1. Anode: Biochar from **[biorefinery](../components/pods/biorefinery-pod.md)** digestate → carbonization  
2. Cathode: Prussian blue synthesized from iron-rich slag (plasma byproducts)  
3. Electrolyte: Sodium salts from brine/seawater processing  
4. Assembly: Robotic lines in **[Mini-Fab](../components/kits/mini-fab-kit.md)** cleanrooms  
5. Recycling: End-of-life cells → plasma refining → 95% material recovery  

## Manufacturing & Scaling

- **Initial Site**: Co-located with **[Tile Production Pod](../components/pods/tile-production-pod.md)** (shared slag feedstock)  
- **Capacity Ramp**:  
  - 2030–2035: 50–200 GWh/year per mature hub  
  - 2040s: 1–5 TWh/year network-wide  
- **CAPEX per GWh**: $60–$120M (mature; declining with scale & recycling)  
- **OPEX**: 65–82% margins via waste inputs & automation
