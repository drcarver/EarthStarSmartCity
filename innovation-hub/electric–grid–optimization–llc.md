## Objective

The **Electric Grid Optimization LLC** manages the Network's transition to an all-electric energy system, prioritizing battery tiles, inductive charging tracks, smart microgrids, and biogas methane as backup power source where needed. It replaces hydrogen-focused infrastructure, reducing handling complexity while maintaining resilience for heavy-duty/long-range applications.

## Key Functions & Synergies

- **All-Electric Primary**: Power distribution via **[sodium-ion storage tiles](components/tiles/energy-storage-thermal-tile.md)** and BIPV roofs.
- **Inductive Charging Tracks**: Embedded in **[permeable road tiles](components/tiles/permeable-road-path-tile.md)** and **[high-speed rail tracks](components/tiles/ceramic-rail-tracks.md)** for continuous charging of robotaxis, trains, and heavy vehicles.
- **Smart Microgrids**: AI-optimized local grids with dynamic load balancing, using **[energy storage pods](components/pods/energy-storage-pods.md)** and **[waste heat recovery](components/pods/waste-heat-recovery-pods.md)**.
- **Biogas Methane Backup**: Fuel cells powered by **[biogas digester pods](components/pods/biogas-digester-pod.md)** for peak/off-grid resilience (e.g., winter, nuclear winter scenarios).
- **Synergies**: Integrates with **[Battery & Storage LLC](innovation-hub/battery-storage-llc.md)** for sodium-ion scaling, **[Autonomous Mobility LLC](innovation-hub/autonomous-mobility-llc.md)** for electric fleets, and **[Sustainable Energy LLC](innovation-hub/sustainable-energy-llc.md)** for biogas-to-methane conversion.

## Manufacturing Process

- Location: **[TerraFab Manufacturing LLC](innovation-hub/terrafab-manufacturing-llc.md)** facilities in hubs.
- Inputs: 70–95% waste-derived (C&D slag, rice husk ash silica, farm residues, brownfield/ELFM slag).
- Materials: Toughened ceramics (60–100+ MPa) with copper/inductive coils, RISC-V controllers, sodium-ion cells.
- Process: Ceramic molding → coil/electronics embed → lamination → firing → QC.
- New Kit: Inductive Charging Track Kit (coils, sensors, connectors; $200k–$400k cost, $400k–$800k selling).

## Recomputed Costs & Revenues (per Mature Hub, February 2026 Baseline)

- CAPEX: $80–$200M (up 10% from hydrogen savings offset by track embeds; phased 2030–2035).
- OPEX: 18–28% of revenue (automation + AI optimization).
- Production Cost: Inductive tiles $50–$100/m²; methane fuel cells $100k–$250k/unit.
- Selling Price: Inductive tiles $150–$300/m²; methane systems $300k–$600k/unit (premium resilience branding +20–30%).
- Annual Revenue: $180–$450M (affiliate sales 35%, external contracts 30%, internal use 35%; margins 65–85%).
- Revenue Uplift from Enhancements: +15–25% ($27–$113M/year) via AI microgrid efficiency and biogas methane credits.
- IRR Contribution: +8–12% to network (overall 38–55%).
- Timeline: Pilots 2028–2030; mature production 2031–2035 (accelerated 6–12 months via electric simplicity).

## Viability Analysis & Suggestions

Shift to all-electric (with biogas methane backup) enhances viability +5–10% (simpler logistics, lower risks, faster bootstrap); aligns with battery tile readiness. Suggestions: Enhance **[Battery & Storage LLC](innovation-hub/battery-storage-llc.md)** with biogas hybrids for resilience; add inductive track kits to **[High-Speed Rail LLC](innovation-hub/high-speed-rail-llc.md)**; recompute confirms no delays, costs down.
