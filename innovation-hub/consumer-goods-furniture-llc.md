## 1. Overview & Mission

The **Consumer Goods & Furniture LLC** is one of the 19 entities in the Genesis Network Innovation Hub. It specializes in designing, manufacturing, and distributing **consumer goods** and **furniture** using **waste-derived toughened ceramics**, recycled materials, and embedded smart technologies. All products are produced in modular facilities (TerraFab pods or dedicated clusters) and integrate seamlessly with the Network's closed-loop ecosystem.

**Mission**:  
- Produce durable, regenerative **furniture** and **consumer goods** (e.g., tables, chairs, cabinets, appliances, lighting, storage units)  
- Embed **sensors**, **compute**, and **networking** for smart home/office integration  
- Achieve 70–95% waste-derived materials → minimize virgin inputs  
- Generate revenue through internal Network supply + external sales/affiliate kits  
- Support **sustainable building codes** and **smart city standards** (ISO/TC 268, IEEE 2030, Matter/Thread/Zigbee)

## 2. Manufacturing & Supply Chain

**All products** are manufactured from **tiles**, **ceramics**, and **kits** supplied by the **Tile Production Facilities** (tent kilns → permanent factories).  
- **Inputs**: 70–95% waste-derived (C&D slag, rice husk ash silica, farm residues, ELFM slag, recycled plastics/metals)  
- **Materials**: Toughened ceramic composite (60–100+ MPa) + embedded features (BIPV, piezo, sensors, Faraday mesh)  
- **Process**: Tile forming → module integration → assembly in cleanroom pods  
- **Cost Basis**: Production $5–$25/unit (simple furniture) to $500–$2,000/unit (smart appliances)  
- **Revenue Model**: Internal supply (zero-cost to Network) + external sales (60–80% margins); affiliate kit sales; premium upgrades
