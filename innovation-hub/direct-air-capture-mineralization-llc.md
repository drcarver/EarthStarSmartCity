# Direct Air Capture & Mineralization LLC

**Overview**  
The **Direct Air Capture & Mineralization LLC** is one of the 19 LLCs in the **Genesis Network Innovation Hub**. It develops, deploys, and operates modular **Direct Air Capture (DAC)** systems using **Genesis** ceramic membranes and surplus energy from hubs (biogas, BIPV, waste heat). Captured CO₂ is mineralized into aggregates for **Genesis** tiles, concrete, or export as premium carbon credits. The LLC accelerates gigaton-scale sequestration while generating high-margin revenue.

**Core Objectives**  
- Achieve 10,000–50,000 tCO₂e/year per mature hub by 2040s  
- Mineralize CO₂ into durable products (tiles, RCA concrete) → circular economy  
- Provide verifiable blockchain credits ($150–250/tCO₂e)  
- Integrate with **restoration kits** and blue-green carbon for planetary impact  

**Technology Stack**  
- **DAC Modules**: Ceramic membranes (waste silica-derived) + amine sorbents or electrochemical cells  
- **Energy Source**: Surplus biogas/BIPV/waste heat (95–98% utilization)  
- **Mineralization**: CO₂ + basalt/olivine/brine → carbonates (calcite, magnesite) for aggregates  
- **Monitoring**: Hyper-dense sensors (CO₂ flux, energy efficiency, mineral stability)  
- **Automation**: 80–95% lights-out; robotic pelletizing/packaging  

**Integration**  
- Co-located with biorefineries/plasma units for heat/energy  
- CO₂ piped to mineralization plants → products feed tile/concrete production  
- Feedback to **data moat**: Sensor data refines DAC efficiency → global twin optimization  

**Phased Rollout**  
- **2027–2030**: Pilot modules (100–500 tCO₂e/year/hub); test ceramic membranes  
- **2031–2035**: Scale to 1,000–5,000 tCO₂e/year; mineralization online  
- **2036–2045**: Mature network (10,000–50,000 tCO₂e/year/hub); gigaton contribution  
- **2046+**: Export kits to affiliates/sovereign partners  

**Financials (Recomputed – Base Scenario)**  
- **CAPEX**: $100–200M/hub (phased 2030s); network-wide $2–5B by 2040  
- **OPEX**: $20–50M/hub/year (energy/maintenance)  
- **Revenue**: $50–150M/hub/year (credits $150–250/tCO₂e + aggregate sales)  
- **Margins**: 70–85% (low energy cost, high credit premiums)  
- **ROI**: <3 years per hub; network IRR contribution +5–10%
