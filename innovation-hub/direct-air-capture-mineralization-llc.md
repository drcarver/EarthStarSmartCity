# Direct Air Capture & Mineralization LLC

## Executive Overview

The Direct Air Capture & Mineralization LLC develops and operates modular direct air capture (DAC) systems that utilize surplus waste heat and low-carbon energy from Genesis hubs to remove CO₂ from the atmosphere. Captured CO₂ is mineralized into stable carbonates for integration into aggregates and ceramic tile production or used for enhanced weathering applications. The LLC generates high-value carbon removal credits while supplying internal feedstock for tile manufacturing and construction materials. Pilots begin in the 2030s with phased scaling post-2040, contributing $50–150M annual revenue per mature hub through premium credits ($150–250/tCO₂e) and material cost offsets. This LLC strengthens the Network’s carbon-negative leadership and creates a new high-margin revenue stream.

**Project Phase**: Deferred high-margin (2030–2035 pilots; mature integration 2040+).

**Financials**  
- CAPEX per hub: $100–200M (phased; modular ceramic units).  
- OPEX per hub (mature): $20–50M/year.  
- Revenue per hub (mature): $50–150M/year (credits + internal offsets).  
- ROI: <4 years; margins 60–80%.

## Viability & Integration Notes

DAC & Mineralization LLC is a high-margin, deferred addition that leverages existing waste heat and ceramic production for low incremental CAPEX. It significantly enhances carbon-negative credentials, generates premium credits, and creates internal feedstock loops for tile manufacturing. Integration is seamless with biorefinery and energy LLCs; pilots validate mineralization pathways before full scaling. Primary risks (energy intensity, credit market volatility) are mitigated by waste heat utilization and blockchain-verified reporting.
