# Vertical Urban Farming LLC

## Executive Overview

The Vertical Urban Farming LLC specializes in balcony, rooftop, and integrated building systems that boost food production capacity by 30–50% without additional land use. Deployed in Phase 2 (2028–2032) of the Genesis Network, it leverages modular ceramics and aquaponics to create biophilic, high-yield urban agriculture. Estimated CAPEX addition: $80–200M per hub; revenue uplift: $150–450M/year from premium produce sales and community-supported agriculture.

## Viability & Integration Notes

The Vertical Urban Farming LLC enhances network viability by adding 30–50% food capacity in dense residential zones, reducing land needs and improving biophilic livability. Integrates seamlessly with core tiles/pods for rooftop/balcony deployment, supporting Phase 2 scaling. Financials assume 60–80% margins on premium urban produce; risks include regulatory zoning for rooftop loads, mitigated by modular light-weight designs.
