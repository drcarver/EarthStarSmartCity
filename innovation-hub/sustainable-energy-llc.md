# Sustainable Energy LLC

## Executive Overview

The Sustainable Energy LLC develops and deploys regenerative energy solutions for the Genesis Network, emphasizing waste heat recovery from biorefineries, kilns, and plasma processes, integrated with biogas microturbines, agrivoltaics, and DC-dominant microgrids. It ensures net-positive energy across hubs (biogas + solar + piezo > internal needs), with surpluses subsidized to affiliates ($0–$0.05/kWh). Phase: Early Scale (2028–2030 rollout); Financials: CAPEX $80–200M/hub, Revenue Uplift $195–660M/hub/year (power sales + efficiencies).
