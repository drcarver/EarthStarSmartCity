## 1. Overview & Mission

**TerraFab (Electronics & Appliances) LLC** is one of the 19 independent LLCs in the Genesis Network's innovation hub. It focuses on sovereign, regenerative manufacturing of electronics (sensors, edge AI, RISC-V processors) and DC-native appliances (refrigerators, ovens, washers, entertainment systems) using waste-derived ceramics, 3D printing, and plasma processes.

**Mission**  
- Achieve high-yield, closed-loop production of niche sovereign chips and appliances  
- Minimize virgin mining through recycling and ceramic substitution  
- Support Network self-sufficiency (pods, hubs, compute tiles)  
- Generate high-margin revenue for self-funding (no external equity)  

**Integration**  
- Co-located with hubs on brownfield sites  
- Uses **[Ceramic Tile & Pipe Production](components/tile-pipe-production.md)** kits for cleanroom shells  
- Feeds **[Robotics & Automation](components/robotics-automation.md)** LLC and **[Compute / Server Tile](components/tiles/compute-server-tile.md)** production

**Sensor Handbook Notes**  
- All sensors self-powered, 3–5× redundant; edge AI for anomaly detection  
- Data feeds local twin → network moat for yield optimization (20–60% gains)  

## 7. Viability Enhancements Specific to TerraFab

- **Phased Triggers**: Strict milestones prevent overreach  
- **Regenerative Inputs**: Waste-derived ceramics + plasma recycling reduce costs 30–50%  
- **Niche Focus**: Sovereign chips avoid mass-market competition  
- **Risk Isolation**: Independent LLC; failure does not impact aquaponics/livestock
