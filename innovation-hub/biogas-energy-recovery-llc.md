# Biogas & Energy Recovery LLC  
**Detailed Specification – January 2026 Baseline**

## Executive Overview

The Biogas & Energy Recovery LLC focuses on converting organic wastes, manure, and biomass into renewable biogas (methane, CO₂) and upgraded biomethane for power generation, heating, and industrial use, while producing digestate fertilizer for closed-loop agriculture. Core products include biogas microturbines, syngas from plasma gasification, and heat recovery systems. Launch timeline: Pilots in 2027–2028 with full integration by 2030. Revenue role: Generates $4–15B/year network-wide (mature 2040s) from energy exports, tipping fees, and credits ($150–250/tCO₂e equivalent), with per-hub CAPEX $0.8–2.5M, OPEX $0.3–0.9M/year, and revenue $1.5–5.0M/year (60–78% margins).

## Viability & Integration Notes

The Biogas & Energy Recovery LLC is highly viable (8.5/10) due to proven anaerobic tech, abundant feedstock from waste/ag/livestock, and direct integration with biorefinery/digester pods for 95–99% energy closure. It mitigates risks via sensor redundancy for monitoring and microbial inoculants for stability. Financials support early self-funding, with tipping fees and credits providing quick wins. All buildings use ceramic tiles/kits only, with smart airlocks (mmWave/hyperspectral scanning for weapons/explosives/security alerts). Complies with ISO/TC 268, IEEE 2030, and sustainable building codes via passive design and waste heat recovery.
