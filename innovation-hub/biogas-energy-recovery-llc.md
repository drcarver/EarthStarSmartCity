### Executive Overview

The Biogas & Energy Recovery LLC operates distributed anaerobic digestion systems and microturbine generators to convert organic waste (manure, food scraps, crop residues, sewage sludge) into biomethane, digestate fertilizer, and renewable electricity/heat. Core mission is to achieve net-positive energy across every Genesis hub while closing nutrient loops. Primary products include pipeline-quality biomethane, electricity sold internally or to affiliates, heat for greenhouse/aquaponics, and high-value digestate. Launch timeline: 2026–2027 pilot pods → full hub integration by 2030. Revenue role: 12–18% of mature hub income ($80–250M/year per hub), with 65–82% gross margins after automation.

### Viability & Integration Notes

- **Viability Rating**: 8.9/10 — Biogas provides one of the fastest ROI components (cash flow within 6–12 months of pod deployment); 65–82% margins mature due to free feedstock (farm/livestock waste) and internal power/heat use.  
- **Bottleneck Reduction**: Pre-seeded inoculum from staging hubs cuts startup to 1–2 weeks; dense gas sensors + digital twins enable predictive yield optimization.  
- **Integration**: Direct piping from livestock/aquaponics pods; heat exported to greenhouses; digestate to microbial & agroforestry systems; electricity to DC microgrid.  
- **Risk Note**: Methane leak detection mandatory; compliant flaring backup required per EPA rules.
