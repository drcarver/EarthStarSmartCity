# Genesis Network: TerraWell FreeCare LLC Specification

## Objective

**TerraWell FreeCare LLC** is the dedicated nonprofit entity providing **completely free**, hospital-level primary, urgent, mental, and preventive healthcare to all Genesis hub residents, affiliates, smallholder partners, and surrounding communities—serving as the humanitarian and political anchor of the Network. It operates independently from for-profit LLCs for liability isolation and tax advantages while integrating seamlessly with **Regenerative Hubs LLC**, **Residential & Community Zones**, and **Dense Sensor Net** infrastructure.

Core goals:
- Eliminate healthcare access barriers in food deserts and distressed rural/urban areas
- Leverage Genesis tech (biosensors, AI twins, microbial inoculants, closed-loop nutrition) for preventive/wellness focus
- Generate goodwill to accelerate permitting, adoption, and political viability
- Self-fund operations via Network surplus allocation (20–40% of hub profits) + donations/credits

## Core Principles

1. **Universal Free Access**  
   No cost, no insurance required—funded by Network surplus and voluntary donations.

2. **Preventive & Regenerative Focus**  
   Nutrition from hub aquaponics/vertical ag + microbial boosts + biosensor monitoring to minimize acute needs.

3. **Modular & Scalable Delivery**  
   Ceramic tile clinics/pods with smart airlocks; telepresence for specialists; mobile units for affiliates.

4. **Privacy & Sovereignty**  
   Local-first data processing via **Communicator Badge** and **Dense Sensor Net**; opt-in federation only.

5. **Integration Without Dependency**  
   Nonprofit status isolates risk; surplus allocation ensures sustainability.
