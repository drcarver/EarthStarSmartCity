# TerraWell FreeCare Support LLC

The TerraWell FreeCare Support LLC provides manufacturing and logistical support for the independent TerraWell FreeCare nonprofit, producing durable medical equipment (DME), modular facilities, and related components using Genesis Network tiles, pods, and kits. It ensures arm's-length, compliant supply of tangible goods for free distribution in FreeCare centers and mobile units, focusing on 3D-printed DME, ceramic-based structures, and sensor-integrated security features. This LLC operates within the Innovation Hub, enabling humanitarian impact while generating revenue through internal transfers and efficiencies.

## Viability & Integration Notes

The TerraWell FreeCare Support LLC enhances humanitarian viability by enabling efficient, compliant production of DME and facilities, with low-risk integration via arm's-length donations. It leverages Genesis components for cost savings (20–40% via waste-derived materials) and rapid scaling (Phase 2027–2028 pilots). Financially, it generates internal revenue through transfers ($200–600M/year mature) while boosting overall Network goodwill and permitting acceleration. Risks are minimal due to regulatory compliance focus and separation from nonprofit operations.
