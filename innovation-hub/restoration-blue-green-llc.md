# Restoration & Blue-Green Carbon LLC  
**Specification Sheet**

## Executive Overview

The Restoration & Blue-Green Carbon LLC focuses on large-scale deployment of regenerative coastal and wetland ecosystems (seagrass, mangroves, corals, kelp forests, oyster reefs, salt marshes) to achieve gigaton-scale carbon sequestration, biodiversity restoration, coastal protection, and water quality improvement. Core products include modular restoration kits and supporting pods, generating high-margin blockchain-verified carbon/biodiversity credits while supplying ecosystem services to Genesis hubs and affiliates. Revenue role: High-margin credits ($150–250/tCO₂e equivalent) + kit sales to smallholders and sovereign partners. Timeline: Pilot deployment 2028–2032; regional scale 2033–2040; global leadership post-2045. Mature contribution: $200–600M/year per hub + network-wide $10–50B/year in credits.

## Viability & Integration Notes

This LLC provides high-margin, verifiable carbon/biodiversity credits that accelerate self-funding while enhancing coastal resilience and water quality for Genesis hubs. Integration with microbial inoculants and water purification LLCs creates synergies for rapid ecosystem recovery on remediated brownfields/landfills. Revenue stability from credits offsets variability in food/energy streams; global export potential post-2045 strengthens international licensing.
