# Genesis Network: **Autonomous Mobility LLC**

## Objective

**Autonomous Mobility LLC** develops, deploys, and operates a fully electric autonomous transportation system within the Genesis Network, prioritizing **robotaxis** leased or purchased from Tesla for passenger mobility, **Tesla Superchargers** (rebranded as Genesis Charging Stations) for charging infrastructure, and **Tesla Semi** for freight transport where needed. This LLC eliminates hydrogen dependency in mobility, leveraging the Network's **[battery & storage tiles](components/tiles/energy-storage-thermal-tile.md)** and **[permeable road tiles](components/tiles/permeable-road-path-tile.md)** with inductive charging embeds for seamless, zero-emission movement.

The system integrates with **[smart roads](components/tiles/permeable-road-path-tile.md)** and **[high-speed rail extensions](innovation-hub/high-speed-rail-transport-llc.md)**, supporting hub-to-hub, intra-city, and affiliate farm connectivity. All vehicles and charging infrastructure are electric-first, with biogas methane as emergency backup only (e.g., remote generator fallback).

## Key Functions & Synergies

- **Robotaxi Fleet**: Tesla-sourced vehicles (leased/purchased) for passenger transport in hubs, residential zones, and TerraWell centers.
- **Rebranded Tesla Superchargers**: Genesis-branded charging stations deployed along **[smart roads](components/tiles/permeable-road-path-tile.md)** and in plazas; inductive charging embeds in roads for dynamic charging.
- **Tesla Semi for Transport**: Used for heavy freight (e.g., tiles, produce, gases) between hubs and affiliates where inductive road charging is insufficient.
- **Synergies**:
  - Power from **[sustainable energy LLC](innovation-hub/sustainable-energy-llc.md)** and **[battery & storage LLC](innovation-hub/battery-storage-llc.md)**.
  - Data from **[dense sensor net kit](components/kits/dense-sensor-net-kit.md)** and **[communicator badge](innovation-hub/communicator-badge-llc.md)** for traffic optimization.
  - Integration with **[autonomous mobility pods](components/pods/autonomous-mobility-pod.md)** for last-mile delivery.

## Manufacturing & Infrastructure

- **Vehicle Sourcing**: Tesla robotaxis and **Tesla Semi** leased or purchased (bulk contracts negotiated via **Autonomous Mobility LLC**).
- **Charging Infrastructure**: Tesla Superchargers rebranded (Genesis branding applied post-purchase); inductive charging embedded in **[permeable road tiles](components/tiles/permeable-road-path-tile.md)**.
- **Manufacturing**: Tiles and charging embeds produced in **[Tile & Pipe Production Pod](components/pods/tile-pipe-production-pod.md)** → permanent factories.
- **Inputs**: 70–95% waste-derived ceramics (C&D slag, RHA silica); Tesla vehicles sourced externally.
- **Materials**: Ceramic for charging stations/road embeds; Tesla battery/electric drivetrains.
- **New Kit**: **Electric Charging Infrastructure Kit** (inductive pads, rebranded Supercharger modules; $200k–$400k cost, $400k–$800k selling).

## Smart Airlocks & Standards Compliance

- All charging stations, vehicle depots, and related buildings use **[smart airlock module tiles](components/tiles/smart-airlock-module-tile.md)** with mmWave/hyperspectral + trace detectors for weapons/explosives scanning; alerts security via **[dense sensor net](components/kits/dense-sensor-net-kit.md)**.
- Compliance: ISO/TC 268 (smart city), IEEE 2030 (smart grid), ITU-T Y.4900 (IoT), Matter/Thread (security), ISO 14001 (sustainable building codes).

## Recomputed Costs & Revenues (per Mature Hub, February 2026 Baseline)

- **CAPEX**: $150–$350M (down 10–15% from hydrogen elimination; Tesla vehicle leases offset initial fleet costs).
- **OPEX**: 25–35% of revenue (automation + inductive efficiency).
- **Production/Lease Cost**: Robotaxis $30k–$50k/unit leased; **Tesla Semi** $150k–$250k/unit; charging stations $50k–$100k/unit.
- **Selling/Revenue Price**: Ride fees $0.50–$1.50/km; freight $0.10–$0.30/km; charging $0.20–$0.40/kWh (premium for Genesis users).
- **Annual Revenue**: $200–$600M (robotaxi rides 50%, freight 20%, charging 20%, leasing 10%; margins 65–85%).
- **Revenue Uplift from Enhancements**: +15–25% ($30–$150M/year) via inductive road charging (dynamic power) and affiliate integration.
- **IRR Contribution**: +8–12% to network (overall 38–55%).
- **Timeline**: Pilots 2028–2030; mature fleet/charging 2031–2035 (accelerated 6 months via Tesla partnership).
