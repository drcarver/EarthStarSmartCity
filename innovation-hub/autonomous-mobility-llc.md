## Mission & Vision

The **Genesis Network** is a pod-centric, self-replicating regenerative ecosystem that transforms degraded lands (distressed farms, brownfields, closed landfills) into closed-loop hubs delivering food, energy, water, materials, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and community services at 95–99% resource closure. The system is **strictly self-funded** through bootstrapped revenues (tiles, biogas, premium food, industrial gases, kits, carbon/biodiversity credits) with no external equity investors.

**Core Objectives**  
- Feed, house, and provide essentials/services to 370–400 million people in regenerative cities by 2060–2070 (U.S. mission)  
- Empower 100,000+ smallholder/co-op mini-hubs globally via subsidized kits, loans, and training  
- Achieve gigaton-scale carbon sequestration, ocean/atmospheric remediation, and mining-minimal circular economy  
- Extend to lunar/Mars settlements, asteroid mining, O'Neill cylinders, and von Neumann probes post-2070

## Core Components & Hyperlinks

## Sensor Handbook – Dense Network Standard

Every tile, pod, and structure deploys **3–5× redundant sensors** for optimization, compliance, security, and off-world planning.

| Sensor Category         | Key Types                                          | Primary Functions                                  | Integration Level          | Lifespan / Redundancy |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| Environmental           | Temperature, humidity, PAR, VOC, CO₂, ammonia      | Climate/yield optimization, air quality            | All tiles & pods           | 10–15 years / 3–5×    |
| Structural              | Strain, vibration, tilt, crack detection           | Predictive maintenance, seismic early warning      | Load-bearing & roads       | 15–25 years / 3–5×    |
| Power / Energy          | Voltage, current, piezo/BIPV output                | Harvest optimization, fault detection              | BIPV/piezo tiles           | 10–20 years / 4×      |
| Water                   | Flow, pH, EC, turbidity, condensate quality       | Closure monitoring, potable safety                 | AWG & plumbing             | 8–12 years / 3–5×     |
| Security / Biosecurity  | mmWave radar, hyperspectral (weapons/explosives)   | Threat detection, airlock triage                   | All airlocks & perimeters  | 10–15 years / 3–5×    |
| Biological / Soil       | Microbial activity, nutrient levels                | Inoculant optimization, yield prediction           | Aquaponics & agroforestry  | 5–10 years / 3×       |
| Off-World               | Radiation, regolith composition, seismic           | ISRU planning, habitat integrity                   | Lunar/Mars pods            | 20–30 years / 4–6×    |

**Smart Airlocks**: Mandatory in all buildings – mmWave + hyperspectral scanning for weapons/explosives/pathogens; alerts security + hub AI.
