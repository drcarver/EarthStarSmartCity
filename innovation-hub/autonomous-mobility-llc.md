# Autonomous Mobility LLC  
**Detailed Specification – January 2026 Baseline**

## Executive Overview

The Autonomous Mobility LLC develops and deploys robotaxi fleets, inductive charging infrastructure, and autonomous vehicle systems integrated with the Genesis Network's smart roads and energy grids. Leveraging embedded sensors, distributed AI, and regenerative power sources, it provides zero-emission, on-demand mobility with infinite range for short-range vehicles, reducing reliance on personal EVs and enabling seamless transport within and between hubs. This LLC supports the Network's goal of internalizing transportation, with initial focus on U.S. hubs and phased rollout to NATO-aligned partners.
