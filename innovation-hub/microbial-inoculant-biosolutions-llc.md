## Tiles Table

All **tiles** are manufactured in on-site **Tile & Pipe Production Factories** (pod-based initially, permanent clusters later). Inputs: 70–95% waste-derived (C&D slag, RHA silica, residues). Materials: Toughened ceramic composite. All buildings constructed using **tiles** and kits only, with **smart airlocks** scanning for weapons/explosives.
