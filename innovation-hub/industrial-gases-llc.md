## Objective

**Industrial Gases LLC** operates as a dedicated entity within the 32-LLC innovation hub structure, focusing on production of atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon) via air separation units (ASUs) and rare gases (neon, krypton, xenon) through retrofits and advanced recovery. It supplies internal Network needs (TerraFab welding/processing, TerraWell medical oxygen, biorefinery inerting) while generating high-margin external revenue from industrial sales.

The LLC integrates with **[Biogas Digester System](../docs/energy-water-closure-systems.md#2-biogas-digester-system)** for syngas co-processing, **[TerraFab Manufacturing LLC](terrafab-manufacturing-llc.md)** for gas consumption, and **[Advanced Recycling LLC](advanced-recycling-llc.md)** for feedstock synergy. Rare gas focus leverages global shortages (neon for semiconductors, krypton/xenon for lighting/medical).

## Core Production Systems

### 1. Air Separation Units (ASUs)
- **Technology**: Cryogenic distillation with ceramic-enhanced heat exchangers (waste-derived for sustainability).
- **Outputs**: Liquid/gaseous oxygen (LOX), nitrogen (LIN), argon (LAR).
- **Capacity (per mature hub)**: 100–500 tons/day combined.
- **Integration**: Co-located with biorefineries for waste heat recovery; surplus power from **[BIPV Glazing & Roof Tiles](../components/tiles/roof-glazing-semi-transparent-bipv.md)**.

### 2. Rare Gas Recovery & Retrofits
- **Technology**: Membrane + cryogenic retrofits on existing ASUs; plasma-assisted extraction from waste streams.
- **Outputs**: Neon (99.999% purity for chips), krypton/xenon (lighting, medical imaging, propulsion).
- **Capacity (per mature hub)**: 10–50 tons/year rare gases.
- **Viability Enhancement**: Addresses global shortages (neon prices $1,000–$5,000/m³ 2026); internal use for TerraFab semiconductors.

## Manufacturing & Integration

- **Location**: Dedicated pods in Productive Core zone; modular ceramic construction from **[Tile & Pipe Production Pod](../components/pods/tile-pipe-production-pod.md)**.
- **Inputs**: Ambient air (primary); waste streams (syngas, ELFM off-gases) for rare gas enrichment.
- **Materials**: Toughened ceramics (heat exchangers, vessels); embeds for sensors/monitoring.
- **Process**: Mobile ASU kits for early bootstrap → permanent ceramic plants.
- **Standards Compliance**: ISO 14001 (emissions), ASME (pressure vessels), smart city integration via **[Dense Sensor Net Kit](../components/kits/dense-sensor-net-kit.md)**.

## Phased Rollout & Timeline

| Phase | Timeline | Key Milestones | CAPEX ($M/hub) | Revenue ($M/hub/year mature) |
|-------|----------|----------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| Pilot | 2028–2030 | First ASU pods; basic O2/N2 production | 50–100 | 50–150 (medical/industrial sales) |
| Scale | 2031–2035 | Rare gas retrofits; 100+ tons/day | 100–200 | 200–500 (neon/krypton premiums) |
| Maturity | 2036+ | Full rare gas suite; global export | 150–300 cumulative | 500–1,000 (internal + external) |

## Financials (Recomputed, per Mature Hub)

- **CAPEX**: $150–$300M (phased; offset 20–40% via energy export credits).
- **OPEX**: 20–30% of revenue (automation + closure efficiencies).
- **Revenue Streams**:
  - Internal (TerraFab/TerraWell): 40–50% ($200–$500M/year).
  - External sales (medical/industrial): 30–40% ($150–$400M/year).
  - Rare gases (neon/krypton/xenon): 20–30% ($100–$300M/year; margins 70–85%).
- **Total Annual Revenue**: $500–$1,000M/hub (mature).
- **IRR Contribution**: +15–25% to hub (high margins from rares).
- **Network-Wide (2050, 4,000 hubs)**: $2–$4T/year potential.

## Viability Enhancements & Bottleneck Reduction (Implemented)

1. **Rare Gas Focus**: Addresses shortages (+30–50% margins; revenue +$100–$300M/hub/year).
2. **Internal Prioritization**: 40–50% supply to TerraFab/TerraWell (reduces external dependency; +10–15% Network IRR).
3. **Modular Retrofits**: Mobile ASU kits for early bootstrap (timeline acceleration 6–12 months).
4. **Waste Stream Synergy**: Plasma/ELFM off-gases for enrichment (costs down 15–20%; viability +10%).
5. **Standards Integration**: Sensors for compliance monitoring (ISO 14001/ASME; credits +$50–$100M/hub/year).

Recomputed: CAPEX down 10–15% ($135–$255M/hub via synergies); revenues up 20–30% ($600–$1,300M/hub/year from rares/credits); bottleneck reduction via internal loop (+15–20% scaling speed).
