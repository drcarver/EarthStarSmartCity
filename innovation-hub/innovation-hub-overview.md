# Genesis Network – Complete List of All LLCs in the Innovation Hub

**EarthStar Technologies** | Version: February 2026 | Prepared for Stakeholders, Partners, and Potential Affiliates

The Innovation Hub consists of **32 synergistic LLCs** that collectively deliver the Genesis Network's regenerative capabilities. Each LLC is modular, self-funding where applicable, and operates under the broader ecosystem (tiles, pods, kits, AI OS, data moat). The list is sorted alphabetically by name. Financials are mature-phase estimates per hub (unless noted network-wide). **Security & Surveillance LLC** is highlighted for emphasis.

## Viability & Integration Notes

The 32 LLCs form a diversified, interdependent ecosystem that reduces single-point failure risk and spreads operational oversight. Security & Surveillance LLC plays a critical role in physical resilience and revenue (contracts/services). All LLCs integrate with tiles/pods/kits for modular scaling and self-funding. High overall viability from revenue diversity and data moat synergies.
