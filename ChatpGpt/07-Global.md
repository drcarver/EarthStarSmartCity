# Part 7 – Global Accession Framework (“Open After Proof”)

**Trigger Condition:**  
Global accession opens only after **Fortress West is irreversibly underway**, defined as:
- ≥120 operational MHUE-50k districts outside the U.S.
- ≥20 years of uninterrupted positive cash flow
- ≥8 independent Genesis ceramic factories operating under license
- No unresolved systemic safety, political, or financial failures

At this point, **any sovereign country** may elect to adopt the Genesis city system under **the same licensing, royalty, and compliance framework used in the Americas**.

There are **no special deals, no geopolitical favoritism, and no technology giveaways**.

---

## 7.1 Global Accession Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Same licensing stack**
   - CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 for structural systems
   - 4–6 % gross royalty on all licensed kits
   - Mandatory Earth-Star quality certification

2. **No governance export**
   - Earth-Star exports infrastructure, not political models
   - Cities operate fully under host-nation law

3. **Strict IP retention**
   - Stealth ceramics, AI data-center kits, smart airlocks, and advanced automation remain proprietary
   - No exceptions, including for allies

4. **Cultural & religious accommodation required**
   - Systems must adapt to local customs, labor norms, land tenure, and religious practices
   - Adaptation occurs via **replacement LLCs**, not core IP changes

---

## 7.2 Innovation Hub LLC Transfer Rules (Global)

### LLCs That **Never Transfer**
These remain centralized and identical worldwide:

- Genesis Structural IP Holdings LLC  
- Ceramic Materials Science & QA LLC  
- Export Licensing & Royalty Collection LLC  
- Safety Certification & Failure Analysis LLC  
- Strategic Systems (Stealth / AI / Security) LLC  

These entities **never localize**, never hire foreign staff directly, and never operate facilities abroad.

---

## 7.3 Replacement LLC Model (Global Standard)

When a U.S.-based Innovation Hub LLC cannot legally, culturally, or politically transfer, it is replaced by **one or more localized LLCs** designed to:

- Comply with national law
- Respect cultural and religious constraints
- Interface cleanly with Earth-Star core IP holders
- Limit political and reputational exposure

**Replacement LLCs are licensed operators, not IP owners.**

## 7.6 Strategic Rationale

- Prevents cultural imperialism accusations  
- Reduces regime-change and expropriation risk  
- Limits blast radius of local political failures  
- Preserves Earth-Star IP integrity  
- Makes Genesis cities **globally adoptable without global uniformity**

---

## Final Statement

Global expansion is **opt-in, sovereign, licensed, and modular**.

Any nation may build Genesis cities —  
**but only on terms that preserve physical safety, legal compliance, cultural dignity, and long-term system survivability.**
