# Part 7 – Global Opt-In Expansion Framework (Post–Fortress West)

**Activation Condition:**  
This framework becomes available **only after Fortress West is irreversibly established** (≥75% of planned districts operational, royalty flows stable, and no unresolved sovereign disputes).

**Principle:**  
Any country may opt in to Genesis-based cities **under identical commercial, legal, and IP terms** as the Americas program:
- No political favoritism  
- No security exceptions  
- No structural open-sourcing  
- Full sovereignty respect  

Earth-Star does **not** select countries. Countries **self-select** by accepting the framework.

---

## 1. Universal Opt-In Terms (Non-Negotiable)

All participating countries must accept:

1. **Licensing Model**
   - CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 for civilian tiles & kits  
   - Mandatory **4–6% gross royalty** to Earth-Star  
   - Annual third-party certification audits  

2. **Proprietary Retention**
   - Stealth ceramics  
   - AI data-center kits  
   - Battery gigafactory kits  
   - Smart airlock threat-detection systems  
   - TerraFab core IP  

3. **Construction Rules**
   - 100% Genesis-family tiles, studs, and kits  
   - No substitution with local structural systems  
   - Climate- and culture-specific interiors allowed  

4. **Governance**
   - Local SPVs own assets  
   - Earth-Star holds **no land**  
   - Earth-Star holds **no operating authority**

## 2. Innovation Hub LLC Transfer Rules (Global)

- Religious law (dietary, finance, gender separation)
- Language and education norms
- Data sovereignty
- Labor and union frameworks
- Environmental and land-use law

## 4. Estimated Global LLC Proliferation (At Scale)

| Scope | Approx. New LLCs |
|-----|------------------|
| Per country (average) | 10–14 |
| 50 opt-in countries | 500–700 |
| 80 opt-in countries | 800–1,100 |
| Network-wide steady state | ~1,200 LLCs |

**Mitigation:**  
- Heavy use of **template charters**
- Shared compliance tooling
- Central audit APIs (read-only to Earth-Star)

---

## 5. Why This Scales Without Collapsing

- Earth-Star controls **standards, not people**
- Countries control **culture, labor, religion**
- Revenue scales via **royalties**, not headcount
- Political risk is **fully localized**
- Failure of one country **cannot cascade**

---

## 6. Bottom Line

This opt-in framework makes Genesis cities:

- **Globally adoptable**
- **Culturally non-imperial**
- **Legally survivable**
- **Financially attractive**
- **Geopolitically boring** (by design)

Countries that want abundance can build it.  
Countries that do not are not pressured.
