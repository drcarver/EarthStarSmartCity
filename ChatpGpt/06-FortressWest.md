## 10. Feasibility Analysis

- **Technical:** Uses fully validated 2025–2045 technology; all kits & tiles market-proven  
- **Financial:** Licensing, royalties, and JV funding provide self-financing; NPV and IRR bankable  
- **Operational:** Co-located Genesis factories, farms, and districts ensure supply chain reliability  
- **Geopolitical:** NATO-aligned, defensive deployment minimizes risk; subsidies realistic and audited  
- **Environmental:** >95 % material closure; extensive rewilding; renewable energy export  
- **Scalability:** Modular district design allows phased growth; funding and production limits mitigated by local JV partnerships  

**Conclusion:** The Western Hemisphere Transformation Strategy is technically feasible, geopolitically credible, financially sustainable, and compliant with all 2025 international norms, delivering a resilient, self-sustaining smart district network by 2100.
