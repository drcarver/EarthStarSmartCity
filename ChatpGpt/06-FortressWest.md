- Replace **100% of conventional agriculture** in participating countries via licensed Skyscraper Farm nodes  
- Rewild **510 million acres** outside the U.S.  
- Construct **18,000 miles of 220–250 mph HSR** on politically vetted freight corridors  
- Build **11 additional Genesis-class factories** under mandatory 60/40 local JV + 4–6% royalty  
- Achieve **>95% material closure** using local brownfield, landfill, and demolition feedstock  
- Retain **full proprietary control** of stealth ceramics, AI data-center kits, battery gigafactory kits, and smart airlocks
