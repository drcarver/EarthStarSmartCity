# Earth-Star Industries Skyscraper Farm

The **Earth-Star Industries Skyscraper Farm** is a **15-floor, 5-acre footprint (~300,000 m²)** agricultural facility built entirely from **Enhanced Ceramic Tiles, Smart Studs, and modular kits**. It is designed to feed a **20,000-person district**, recycle **urban waste**, and supply feedstock to the **Earth-Star Tile and Semiconductor Factory**. The farm prioritizes **closed-loop systems, renewable energy, livestock welfare, cultural inclusivity (halal, kosher, vegan)**, and **ISO 37122 smart city standards**.  

All equipment, from aquaculture to cleanrooms, is fabricated from **ceramic tiles and kits** for resilience, recyclability (>95%), and modular expansion.
