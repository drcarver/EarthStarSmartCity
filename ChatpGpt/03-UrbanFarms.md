# Ultra-Closed-Loop Regenerative Ecosystem  
### Transforming Global Agriculture (Prompt 3)

---

## Project Overview

The **Earth-Star Industries Skyscraper Farm** represents a new era of sustainable, regenerative urban agriculture — a **15-floor vertical megastructure** built entirely from **ceramic tiles and modular smart kits** produced by the Earth-Star Industries Facility (Prompt 1). Each structure feeds an estimated **20,000-person urban district**, replacing traditional rural farms with **hyper-efficient, zero-waste ecosystems**.

This system applies **NASA’s Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CLESS)** principles, closed-loop biocycles, and automation technologies available in 2025 to deliver unmatched agricultural and manufacturing performance.

## 5. Rewilding & Expansion

- Abandoned or purchased farms are **converted into rewilded ecosystems**.  
- Introduced fauna include deer, elk, and bison — repopulated via artificial womb programs.  
- Urban brownfield sites use enclosed farms without rewilding.  
- Goal: **100% U.S. food and agricultural product replacement** by 2040.
