# Earth-Star Industries Genesis Facility – Prompt 1

**Master Edition with Version 3 Corrections + Option A Market Mix Allocation**
**Effective Date:** 2 January 2027

> **This is the sole authoritative specification.** All prior prompts, drafts, or versions are fully superseded.

---

## 1. Purpose

This repository contains the full, regulator-ready Prompt 1 specification for the **Earth‑Star Industries Genesis Facility**.
It integrates:

* Locked Design Principles
* Version 2 and Version 3 Realism Corrections
* The validated 33-product list
* **Option A: Realistic Market Mix Allocation**
* Updated capacity, throughput, and revenue ceilings

This document is optimized for GitHub Pages and public technical review.

---

## 2. Locked Design Principles

* All technologies must be commercially realistic and grounded in validated physics.
* Ceramic tiles/panels are **non-structural**.
* No fictional materials, no speculative shielding, no exotic energy systems.
* All production and financials must match **Version 3 strict caps**:

  * **4.16M m²/year** total ceramic production
  * **$530M/year** total revenue limit
  * **$118/m²** average price ceiling
* Deleted product lines remain deleted.
* Robotics systems must be industrially feasible.

---

## 3. Version 3 Corrections (Integrated Summary)

* Firing, pressing, and kiln throughput establish a hard cap of **4.16M m²/year**.
* Tile/panel revenue may not exceed **$438M/year**.
* Total revenue (tiles + robotics) may not exceed **$530M/year**.
* Solar tile efficiency limited to **22%**.
* Radiation and EMI tiles constrained to real attenuation levels.
* No airlocks, no pressurized modules, no habitat shells.
* Only ceramic‑based products plus robotics kits remain valid.

---

## 4. Valid Product Lines (33 Total)

### 4.1 Tile & Panel Variants (30)

Standard cladding, architectural variants, storm-grade tiles, wildfire-resistant, acoustic, radiation attenuating (gamma/neutron), EMI shielding, smart-road tiles, solar-ceramic tiles (22%), sanitary tiles, clean-room panels, snow-shedding tiles, HSR utility tiles, and others.
