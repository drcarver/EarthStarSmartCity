<details>
<summary>📊 Basic HIL v1 Specs & Financials (Click to Expand)</summary>

## 1. Component Specifications

### RTK GNSS Tiles
- **Purpose:** cm-level positioning; hub/grid backbone  
- **Size / Material:** 600×600 mm, 20–35 mm thick, toughened ceramic + embedded antenna  
- **Power:** BIPV edge + piezo  
- **Accuracy:** 1–3 cm (in-network), 5–20 cm PPP fallback  
- **Revenue:** $250–450/m²; cost $38–85/m² → margin 65–75%  
- **Applications:** Precision ag, construction, remediation, emergency location

### Public WiFi Tiles
- **Purpose:** Free rural/urban connectivity, adoption vector  
- **Size / Power:** 300×300 mm, BIPV + piezo  
- **WiFi:** 6/6E, 100–500 Mbps per cluster  
- **Revenue:** $150–350/unit; cost $40–90/unit → margin 55–65%  
- **Model:** Free for affiliates, paid roaming for non-residents

### Basic Communicator Badge v1
- **Purpose:** Personal positioning, voice, basic biosensing  
- **Size / Weight:** 40–55 mm × 10–14 mm, 22–38 g  
- **Power:** Piezo + micro-BIPV + 80–150 mAh solid-state battery  
- **Capabilities:** Voice wake word, small LLM, HR/HRV + motion, RTK positioning  
- **Networking:** Tile mesh → WiFi → cellular fallback  
- **Revenue:** $89–149 retail; cost $28–68/unit → margin 60–65%  
- **Use:** Affiliate/resident adoption, premium upgrades later

## 2. Integrated Flow
1. RTK tiles broadcast corrections → badges achieve cm-level lock  
2. Badge connects via mesh/WiFi → sovereign low-power link  
3. Voice query processed locally  
4. Presence detected anonymously by smart airlocks/walls (if available)  
5. Data stays on-device unless user consents to share

## 3. Deployment & Revenue Strategy

- **Rollout Sequence:**
  1. Embed RTK GNSS tiles in hubs/roads  
  2. Install public WiFi tiles in high-traffic areas  
  3. Distribute badges to affiliates/residents  

- **Early Revenue Streams:**
  - Affiliate perks: Free badges + WiFi → adoption  
  - Data services: Compliance mapping, precision ag → $50–200M/year  
  - Connectivity fees: Premium roaming → $20–100M/year  

- **Network-Wide Potential (2035):**
  - 400–1,000 hubs + 8,000–25,000 affiliates  
  - Annual revenue: $100–400M early → $1–4B mature  

## 4. Strategic Notes

- Minimal viable HIL delivers **maximum early value** (positioning + connectivity + trust)  
- Pruned to reduce complexity and risk  
- Generates immediate affiliate perks and early revenue streams  
- Foundation for HIL v2: display walls, advanced identity, payments
