# Genesis Network – Advanced Fab Contingency Strategy

**Objective:** Ensure uninterrupted advanced compute availability (7 → 3 nm nodes) if internal Mini-Fab development is delayed.

---

## Contingency Tiers & Triggers

| Tier | Description | Trigger | Primary Partners / Options | Estimated Additional Cost | Risk Level | Timeline Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------------|--------------------------|------------|----------------|
| **Tier 1 – Internal Stretch** | Push 28–14 nm yields higher via software/data compensation | 6–18 months delay | — | $100–$400M per hub | Low | 0–12 months |
| **Tier 2 – Trusted External Foundry** | Contract manufacture 7–3 nm with Genesis designs | 18–36 months delay | Samsung Texas, TSMC Arizona, Intel Foundry, GlobalFoundries | $1–$4B initial + 10–25% royalties | Medium | 12–36 months |
| **Tier 3 – COTS Chips** | Use high-performance off-the-shelf chips for non-critical systems | >36 months | Exynos, Snapdragon, NVIDIA Jetson, AMD Ryzen Embedded | $200–$900M per hub | Medium-High | Minimal delay |
| **Tier 4 – Hybrid Downgrade & Software Optimization** | Mature nodes 65–28 nm longer; optimize software for lower performance | >4–5 years | — | Minimal (software R&D) | High | 2–5 years |

## Preferred Tier 2 Partner: Samsung Texas Foundry

- **Rationale:** U.S.-based, advanced 3 nm capability, CHIPS Act incentives, IP-safe.  
- **Engagement Plan:**  
  - 2032: Non-binding LOI  
  - 2033: Test design transfers (65–28 nm validation)  
  - 2034–2035: Activate full contract manufacturing if internal yields <70–75%  
- **Cost Structure:** $1–$3B initial tooling + per-wafer fees + 10–25% royalties  
- **IP Protection:** Genesis retains all design ownership; Samsung only manufactures  

**Alternative Partners:** TSMC Arizona, Intel Foundry Services, GlobalFoundries

## Risk-Adjusted Outcomes

| Scenario | Probability | Timeline Delay | Compute Capability Impact | Network IRR Impact | Mitigation Confidence |
|----------|-------------|----------------|---------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Internal nodes on time | 55–70% | None | Full 7–3 nm sovereign | Baseline | High |
| Mild delay → Tier 1 | 15–25% | 6–18 months | 28–14 nm optimized | –3–8% | Very High |
| Moderate delay → Tier 2 | 10–20% | 18–36 months | 7–3 nm via contract | –5–12% | High |
| Severe delay → Tier 3 | 5–10% | >36 months | Mature + COTS hybrid | –10–20% | Medium |
| Catastrophic → Tier 4 | <5% | 4–7 years | 65–28 nm long-term | –15–30% | Medium-Low |

## Strategic Recommendation

1. **Primary:** Pursue internal Mini-Fab roadmap aggressively.  
2. **Insurance:** Prepare Samsung Texas / TSMC Arizona contingency (LOI, test shuttles, $1–4B budget).  
3. **Fallback:** Use COTS for non-critical systems (badges, signage, secondary robotics).  
4. **IP Protection:** Retain full design control; avoid partners demanding equity or operational control.  

**Outcome:** Maintains advanced compute continuity, sovereign IP protection, and minimal disruption to network expansion or off-world preparation.
