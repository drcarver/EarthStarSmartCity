# Prompt 03A – TerraWell FreeCare System  
**“Everything Free, Everything Deductible” – Locked & Compliant Master Specification (December 2025)**

**First FreeCare centers & mobile units:** Q1 2035  
All timelines, costs, and legal structures validated with 2025-IRS rules, Section 170, and state medical regulations.

---

## Core Mission
Deploy a nationwide (later global) network of **fully free** health & food centers and mobile units:

- Supply food banks with packaged meals branded for the food bank  
- Give away **only legally permissible items** at zero charge  
- Operate as a genuine 501(c)(3) nonprofit (TerraWell Foundation), funded entirely by **Earth-Star Industries fair-market-value donations**  
- Maintain **complete legal separation** from farms, TerraFabs, Genesis factories, and MHUE cities  
- Remain **operationally compliant**, IRS-recognized, and regulator-proof

---

## Mandatory Compliance Constraints

1. **Recipient ID required** – government-issued photo ID and standard medical intake for all services.  
2. **Scheduled drugs** – Only Schedule V and below dispensed without physician visit. Ketamine/psilocybin permanently removed.  
3. **Physician services** – Delivered via contracted independent 1099 physicians or partner FQHCs at fair-market rates; no direct employment by nonprofit.  
4. **Tangible goods only for deductions** – Food, OTC drugs, pre-cleared 510(k)-exempt durable medical devices.  
5. **3D-printed devices** – Limited to pre-approved simple devices (crutches, basic walkers, finger splints). Class II devices (CPAP, powered wheelchairs) must be commercially purchased and donated.  
6. **Security systems** – Standard metal detectors + CCTV; hyperspectral threat-detection airlocks removed.  
7. **Maximum scale** – 62–78 million people/year (≈18–22 % of projected U.S. population).  
8. **Net after-tax cost (2075)** – ≈$15–$18 billion/year (~11–13 % of projected Earth-Star EBITDA).
