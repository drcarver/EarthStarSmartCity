# TerraWell FreeCare System – Executive Summary

**Launch Date:** Q1 2035  
**Mission:** Provide 100 % free food, medicine, medical devices, urgent care, primary care, mental health services, and mobile response to all citizens. Operates fully privately under TerraWell Foundation 501(c)(3), legally and operationally separate from all Earth-Star industrial operations.

---

## 1. Legal & Tax Structure

**Legal Framework:**
- TerraWell Foundation: fully independent board of directors, fiduciary responsibility under IRS 501(c)(3)
- Complete legal firewall: no shared employees, no data integration, no cross-funding from public sources
- All donations from Earth-Star Industries at fair-market-value (FMV)
- Physical separation: all facilities on Genesis brownfield sites, never inside farms, TerraFabs, or cities

**Tax Strategy:**
- Donations counted as charitable contributions at FMV, creating maximum allowable IRS deductions
- FMV donations generate tax shields (30 % blended rate assumed)
- Program effectively becomes cash-flow positive after 2042 when deductions exceed operational costs

**Text Diagram (Flow Description):**
- **Earth-Star Industries (for-profit)** → **FMV Donation** → **TerraWell Foundation (501(c)(3))** → FreeCare Operations
- **Financial Feedback:** Tax savings returned to Earth-Star; no operational or data entanglement
