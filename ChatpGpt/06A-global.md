# Earth-Star Industries International Deployment Strategy – Part 6A

**Assumption:**  
Fortress West (initial U.S./Americas pilot) is fully operational and producing validated results in population, food, energy, and financial metrics.

**Objective:**  
Enable international deployment of MHUE-50k smart city complexes for countries interested in licensing the Earth-Star model.

## Key Principles for International Rollout

1. **Licensing & Partnership**  
   - Countries may license city kits, tiles, and flat-pack systems from Genesis Facility.  
   - All deployments follow identical technical specifications as U.S. MHUE-50k nodes.  
   - Royalty structure: 5 % of total kit/tile cost per deployment.

2. **Technical Compliance**  
   - Cities must use Genesis Facility tiles for cladding/envelope.  
   - All energy, water, farm, and cleanroom systems comply with standards proven in Fortress West.  
   - DC microgrid integration and modular kits mandatory for energy efficiency and replication.

3. **City Configuration Options**  
   - Countries may choose any configuration from the official library: L-01, T-01, F-01, O-01, etc.  
   - Visual, terrain, and population options as per the licensed library.  
   - Local adaptation allowed for climate-specific considerations (e.g., heating/cooling loads, solar insolation, rainfall).

4. **Phased International Rollout**  
   - **Phase 1 (Pilot Licensing):** 2038–2043 – up to 5 international cities in early-adopter countries  
   - **Phase 2 (Regional Expansion):** 2044–2055 – 20–50 cities per continent, leveraging local labor and supply chains  
   - **Phase 3 (Global Integration):** 2056–2075 – full-scale adoption in all interested countries, coordinated with rewilding and agriculture replacement strategies

5. **Supply Chain & Logistics**  
   - Tiles and kits exported from Fortress West (or regional Genesis Facility spin-offs)  
   - Air, sea, and land transport optimized for modular flat-pack delivery  
   - Local assembly using trained construction crews and automated TerraBots

6. **Financial & Incentive Structure**  
   - Licensing fee covers kit/tile royalty and technical support  
   - Optional joint venture for revenue sharing in energy, agriculture, and Terrafab production  
   - Encourage local financing via green bonds, IIJA-style international grants, or carbon credit participation

7. **Standards & Safety**  
   - Smart airlocks, hyperspectral threat detection, and ISO 37122 compliance mandatory for all high-value buildings  
   - Environmental and sustainability standards equivalent to U.S. deployments  
   - Rewilding programs tailored to local ecosystems

8. **Advantages of International Deployment**  
   - Rapid scaling of proven city model with minimized technical risk  
   - Export of U.S. renewable energy, food, and technology benefits via modular system  
   - Promotes global sustainability, biodiversity, and carbon neutrality  
   - Reduces barriers to entry by providing turnkey, bankable city kit solution
