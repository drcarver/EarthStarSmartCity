# Prompt 03B – TerraWell FreeCare System  
**“Optimized Viability – Locked Master Specification (December 2025)”**

**First FreeCare centers & mobile units:** Q1 2035  
All timelines, costs, and legal structures validated using 2025-IRS rules, Section 170, and state medical regulations.

## Strategic Viability Enhancements

1. **Hybrid Funding Model**  
   - Maintain 501(c)(3) nonprofit status, but accept **limited private grants and corporate sponsorships** strictly for capital assets (buildings, vehicles, solar panels), not operational costs.  
   - Retains IRS compliance while reducing net after-tax burden on Earth-Star.

2. **Tiered Service Delivery**  
   - Introduce **telehealth-first triage** to reduce physician on-site load and travel time.  
   - Mobile units prioritize **high-need rural and disaster zones**, reducing fixed infrastructure cost.

3. **Expanded Tangible Deduction Scope (IRS-Compliant)**  
   - Include **long-life capital assets** (solar arrays, 3D-printing labs, cold-chain storage) as tangible donations with FMV deduction, within §170 rules.  
   - Allows partial deduction of renewable-energy investment integrated with humanitarian operation.

4. **Inventory Optimization**  
   - Use **Farm-to-FreeCare dynamic allocation** to balance surplus Skyscraper Farm output with inventory needs.  
   - Reduce waste, ensure maximum FMV deduction efficiency, and minimize overproduction.

5. **Shared Logistics & Energy**  
   - Co-locate mobile unit maintenance hubs with Genesis brownfields for **fuel/energy efficiency**.  
   - Install 5–10 MW microgrids per hub to offset peak load, reducing operational cost.

6. **Scalable 3D Printing Strategy**  
   - Standardize 3D-printable items (crutches, splints, basic walkers) in modular kits.  
   - Partner with **FDA-cleared third-party manufacturers** for higher-class devices to avoid regulatory risk.

7. **Telehealth & Digital Monitoring**  
   - Deploy **centralized telemedicine AI scheduling** and remote diagnostics for routine care.  
   - Minimizes FTE requirements while maintaining patient throughput.

8. **Phase-Based Expansion**  
   - Phase 1 (2035–2040): 500 fixed centers + 1,000 mobile units  
   - Phase 2 (2040–2050): 1,000 fixed centers + 2,000 mobile units  
   - Phase 3 (2050–2075): 1,200 fixed centers + 2,500 mobile units  
   - Scale aligned with **realistic human-resource, supply-chain, and tax compliance constraints**.
