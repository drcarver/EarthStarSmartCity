# Earth-Star TerraFab – Prompt 3  
**Authoritative Final Version (with Full Sensor & Pharma Integration)**

**Project start date:** Post Genesis Facility online (first commercial node: Q1 2032)  
All timelines fixed relative to Genesis and Skyscraper Farm cash flow.

---

## Core Mission
Build a **TerraFab** – an advanced sustainable semiconductor & pharmaceutical campus – fully integrated with Genesis factories and Skyscraper Farms:

- Produce **12–14 nm DUV immersion AI chips** (80,000 wafers/year)  
- Produce **high-volume non-scheduled APIs** (≤6 molecules; ≤7.2 t/year)  
- Manufacture **≥82 % of total sensor value in-house** across phased SensorFab campuses  
- Utilize **hybrid ceramics + virgin materials** and 3D-printed components where feasible  
- Integrate all sensors into the **Earth-Star Central AI & Compliance Portal** for FDA, CHIPS, BIS, and ISO compliance  
- Expand Genesis and Skyscraper Farms to support API precursors, sensor materials, and pharmaceutical crops

## Sensor Production – Locked Roadmap Version 5.0

| Phase | Year Online | Facility Type | Sensors Produced In-House | % of Total Sensor Value | CapEx | Node / Process |
|-------|-------------|---------------|---------------------------|------------------------|-------|----------------|
| 1     | 2036        | Genesis-2 expansion | Basic pressure, strain, temperature, humidity, accelerometers | 28–32 % | $180 M | 350–800 nm MEMS lines (licensed) |
| 2     | 2039        | SensorFab-01 (200 mm) | PAR, CO₂, O₂, pH, EC, DO, VOC, IR thermopile, strain gauges | 68–74 % cumulative | $1.1–1.3 B | 130–180 nm BCD (licensed) |
| 3     | 2045        | SensorFab-02 (300 mm analog/CIS) | Spectral 380–1100 nm, qPCR prep optics, hyperspectral threat pixels | 72–78 % cumulative | $3.6–$4.2 B | 65–90 nm analog/mixed-signal + CIS (licensed IP) |
| 4     | 2047+       | Optional leading-edge CIS/SPAD | LiDAR, medical imaging, ATP bioluminescence | ≤82 % | TBD | 28–40 nm CIS (conditional on CHIPS extension) |

**Mandatory compliance rules:**

- Sensor fabs are physically & air-handling separated ≥800 m from 12–14 nm logic TerraFab  
- No pharmaceutical-grade sensors produced in any logic fab  
- High-precision optical sensors produced only in ISO 14644-1 Class 100–1000 cleanrooms

---

## Pharma & API Integration

- Stainless **continuous-flow hall (TF-07)** produces 3–4 high-volume APIs (ibuprofen, paracetamol, metformin, losartan, omeprazole, atorvastatin)  
- Total API output ≤7.2 t/year by 2045  
- Skyscraper Farms expanded to supply any necessary precursor crops and biomass for continuous-flow production  
- All pharmaceutical sensors, quality metrics, and process controls feed **directly into the Compliance Portal**

---

## Energy Strategy & Site Planning

- High-density (180–220 W/m²) single-axis solar deployed on 1,200 ha surrounding each TerraFab  
- Campus **net electricity balance**: –190 ± 50 GWh/year; 62–68 % of load offset by on-site solar + PPAs  
- Minimum separation (semi ↔ farm/pharma): ≥5 km  
- Total required campus footprint: ≥8,200 ha for fab, solar, buffers, and compliance separation

## Funding & Integration Path (2035–2047)

| Source | Amount | Timeline |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Genesis-1/2/3 FCF | $1.4–1.8 B | 2035–2042 |
| Skyscraper Farm EBITDA | $0.9–1.2 B | 2038–2045 |
| TerraFab-01 dividends | $2.2–3.1 B | 2043–2047 |
| CHIPS/48C incentives (partial SensorFab-02) | $0.8–1.1 B | 2040–2043 |
| **Total self-funded** | $4.1–$5.6 B | CapEx gap for Phase 3: external JV / CHIPS/IRA funding $1.2–1.6 B |

---

## Sensors Permanently Outsourced

| Sensor Type | Reason | Supplier Strategy |
|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| High-end qPCR & ATP pathogen | Requires ISO 5 biotech + FDA validation | Long-term contracts (Sartorius, Bio-Rad) |
| Medical blood/gas analyzers | FDA clinical path too long | Siemens Healthineers, Abbott |
| Radiation-hardened space sensors | Requires specialized SOI/SiC processes | BAE Systems, Honeywell |

## Locked Final Performance – 2045 Steady-State

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Logic node | 12–14 nm DUV immersion |
| Wafer output | 80,000/yr |
| In-house sensor value | ≤82 % |
| APIs produced | 6 molecules, ≤7.2 t/yr |
| Total campus revenue | $1.08–$1.24 B/yr |
| Total campus EBITDA | $720–$880 M/yr |
| Net electricity balance | –190 ± 50 GWh/yr (62–68 % offset via solar) |
