# Executive Summary – TerraFab

**Project Start Date:** Post Genesis Facility full capacity (Q1 2030)  
**Core Mission:** Build a sustainable, hybrid-material, modular semiconductor and medical/pharmaceutical manufacturing facility (TerraFab) co-located with Genesis Facilities and Skyscraper Farms. TerraFab integrates AI chip fabrication, generic prescription/OTC drug production, and sustainable medical supply manufacturing using as much 3D-printed and hybrid ceramic/virgin materials as feasible.

**Key Highlights:**
- Advanced semiconductor fab using 2025-proven nodes for AI chips.
- Modular flat-pack construction using Genesis kits and ceramic hybrid materials.
- Integrated compliance monitoring for all equipment via sensor-enabled portal.
- Sustainable medical supplies: sterile disposables, hospital-grade kits, and simple biologics (vaccine excipients, IV fluids, gauze, syringes).
- Crop extension from Skyscraper Farms to provide feedstock for nutraceuticals, APIs, and biomass for biogas/chemical synthesis.
- Phased construction funded through Genesis Facility revenue and Skyscraper Farm profit streams.
