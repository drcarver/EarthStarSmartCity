- Produce **cutting-edge AI chips** (post-5 nm and beyond)  
- Maximize **3D-printed ceramic and hybrid composite structures**  
- Integrate tightly with **Genesis tile factories**, **Farm complexes**, and **biomanufacturing units**  
- Manufacture **generic pharmaceuticals, OTC drugs, and medical disposables**  
- Use a universal **sensorized kit architecture** for environmental, quality, and safety compliance  
- Operate in **phased expansion**, funded by revenue from Genesis, Farms, and TerraFab itself  

All TerraFabs are **co-located** with Genesis manufacturing clusters and regenerative smart farms to create a closed-loop, vertically integrated industrial base for chips, medicines, and high-complexity technology.
