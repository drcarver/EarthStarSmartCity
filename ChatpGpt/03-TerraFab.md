# 1. Executive Summary

The **TerraFab** is Earth-Star’s flagship **sustainable semiconductor + medical device + advanced manufacturing complex**, built **only after the first Genesis Facility becomes operational**. Each TerraFab is **co-located with**:

- **Genesis ceramic & tile megafactories**
- **Skyscraper Farms (Prompt 2)**
- **Node-level 3D-printing clusters**
- **Energy-positive microgrids**

The TerraFab’s mission is to:

- Produce **leading-edge and mature-node semiconductor wafers**, including AI accelerators, embedded sensors, biosignal processors, and power electronics.
- Manufacture **sterile medical supplies** using farm-derived biomaterials and TerraFab-produced polymers.
- Produce **generic prescription drugs & OTC pharmaceuticals** not already covered by the Skyscraper Farm cleanrooms.
- Integrate **sensorized equipment, robotics, and ceramic 3D-printed modules** to maximize sustainability.
- Run entirely on **renewable power**, **closed-loop water systems**, and **ceramic/printed structural components**.
- Export chips, medical supplies, APIs, sterile disposables, and high-value microelectronics.

TerraFabs are constructed **in sequential phases**, funded primarily by:

- Surplus revenue from **Genesis Factories**
- Surplus revenue from **Skyscraper Farms**
- Early TerraFab output (mature-node chips, steriles)
