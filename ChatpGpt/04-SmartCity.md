## 1. Executive Summary

The MHUE-50k smart city integrates:

- **Residential:** Modular luxury homes/apartments; flexible low-income designation for government compliance
- **Skyscraper Farms:** 2 vertical towers + 2,065 ha horizontal regenerative area for full dietary diversity, aquaponics, cultured meats, grains, nuts, and rotational grazing livestock
- **Healthcare:** Level I trauma hospital with integrated ceramic cleanrooms and 3D-printed medical devices
- **Education:** K–12 campus plus university facilities
- **Commercial:** Shopping, entertainment, hotels, local commerce
- **Industrial:** LFP/Na-ion battery factory, 150 MW AI data center, TerraFab
- **Support/Services:** Government, public amenities, religious structures
