# Earth-Star Industries Smart City Complex

Recomputed costs, revenues, and volumes. All equipment and kits are built from ceramic tiles, studs, and modular kits, as specified in Prompt 1. All buildings use tiles, ceramics, and kits only. Smart airlocks are included in all facilities, compliant with ISO 37122, and all smart city, sustainability, and military standards are applied.
