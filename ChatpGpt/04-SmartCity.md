# Executive Summary – MHUE-50k
**Project Start Date:** Jan 2, 2035

## Core Mission
Construct and operate a 50,000-resident smart city using modular ceramic tiles and flat-pack kits from Genesis Facility. The city integrates:
- Skyscraper Farms for vertical and horizontal food production
- Renewable energy generation and water recycling
- DC-based home appliances, electric barges for waste transport
- Smart city roads, IoT-enabled building management
- High-security and sustainability standards

## Schedule & Milestones
| Milestone | Timeline | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Site Prep & Temporary Campus | Months 0–6 | Initial tent-based operations for modular kit staging |
| TerraBot™ Deployment | Months 6–12 | Robotic assembly of vertical towers and horizontal farm modules |
| Vertical Skyscraper Farm Completion | Month 24 | Full 15-floor towers operational with aquaponics, CEA crops, cultured meat |
| Horizontal Regenerative Farm Operational | Month 26 | Greenhouses, LED supplementation, agrivoltaics, livestock barns complete |
| Residential & Commercial Buildings Occupied | Month 30 | 20,000 residents first phase occupancy |
| Industrial Complex Completion | Month 36 | Data center, battery factory, and terrafab online |
| Full City Capacity (50k residents) | Month 48 | All services and modules operational |
