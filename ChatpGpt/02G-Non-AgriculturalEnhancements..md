## 5. Financial & Strategic Summary

- **Target network-wide revenue (mature)**: $6–$25B/year per major new industry  
- **Payback per component / LLC**: 1–3 years  
- **IRR uplift**: +8–18% blended  
- **Integration Synergies**:  
  - Tiles ↔ Pods ↔ Kits ↔ Digital Twins → predictive optimization & load balancing  
  - Energy, heat recovery, microgrids → closes industrial/urban loops  
  - Health, UV-C, security → compliance + community resilience  
  - Education & retail → monetization flywheel, public engagement  
- **Rollout Strategy**: High-value, low-regulatory-friction LLCs first (Energy Storage, 3D Construction, UV-C Disinfection)  
- **Modularity & Self-Powering**: Snap-together, blind-mate, BIPV, piezo, AWG → reduces OPEX and grid dependency
