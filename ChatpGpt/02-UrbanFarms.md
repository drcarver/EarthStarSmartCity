# Executive Summary – Skyscraper Farm Option B

**Project Start Date:** 2 January 2032  
**Core Mission:** Deploy a nationwide network of hybrid vertical + horizontal regenerative farms (“Skyscraper Farms”) using ceramic flat-pack kits from Genesis Facility. Each node feeds 20,000 people, produces energy and water, and generates high-margin products while enabling U.S. farmland rewilding.  

**Key Highlights:**
- Vertical towers: 150 m tall × 150 m diameter, 15 floors, 265,000 m² CEA for leafy greens, aquaponics, cultured meat, and ISO 5–8 cleanrooms.
- Horizontal regenerative site: 2,065 hectares, covering orchards, nuts, grains, silvopasture, and livestock using 2025-proven regenerative methods.
- Net exporter of energy and water in humid climates.
- Revenue streams: functional foods, vitamins, cultured meat, biodegradable packaging, simple APIs, verified carbon credits.
- Aggressive phased rollout using 3D printing and co-location with Genesis Facilities for integrated energy, water, and smart-grid systems.
