# Earth-Star Industries Skyscraper Farm

This document outlines the **Earth-Star Industries Skyscraper Farm**, an ultra-closed-loop regenerative ecosystem integrated with the Earth-Star Industries Facility. Leveraging **2025 technologies**, including NASA CELSS (Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems), AI automation, and hybrid vertical-horizontal farming, the farm feeds 20,000 people year-round.  

- **Structure**: 15-floor cylindrical skyscraper, 50,000 m² footprint (~750,000 m² growing area via vertical stacking)  
- **Horizontal Greenhouses**: 100,000 m² on brownfield/abandoned sites  
- **Materials**: Tiles, ceramics, and kits from the facility’s factory  
- **Light Pollution**: Minimized via shielded agrivoltaic panels (2700K LEDs)  
- **Excess Resources**: Power and water exported; non-farm land rewilded
