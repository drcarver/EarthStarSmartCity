# Earth-Star Skyscraper Farm – Prompt 2  
**Authoritative Final Version (with Full Sensor Suite & Compliance Portal)**

**Project start date (first commercial node):** 2 January 2032  
All timelines are 100% fixed from this date.

---

## Core Mission
Construct and operate a rapidly replicating network of fully robotic, net-energy/water/power-positive **Skyscraper Farms** built entirely from flat-pack kits manufactured within the Genesis Facility ecosystem.

Each mature node shall:

- Feed **21,000–23,500 people** year-round with complete USDA MyPlate dietary diversity including premium fresh and saltwater fish  
- Generate **≥ $320 million** annual free cash flow after all costs  
- Be a **100% net exporter** of electricity, potable water, and oxygen in every U.S. climate  
- Achieve **>99.99% closed-loop** water, nutrient, carbon, and energy cycles  
- Produce **100%** of its own seed, eggs, and broodstock  
- Sell **≥85%** of its annual ModuGreenhouse-01 production externally at full margin  
- Maintain continuous, real-time, third-party-verified compliance through the **Earth-Star Central AI & Compliance Portal**  
- Colocate with Genesis plants when possible

## Identified Critical Discrepancies

| # | Original Claim | 2025 Physics Violation / Contradiction | Severity |
|---|----------------|-----------------------------------------|----------|
| 1 | Feed 21k–23.5k people | Impossible for <4,000 ha with realistic yields | Critical |
| 2 | Net exporter of electricity, water, **oxygen** in every U.S. climate | Oxygen export impossible; water export impossible in arid climates | Critical |
| 3 | >99.99% closed-loop | Violates thermodynamics + mineral balance | Critical |
| 4 | 100% in-house manufacturing including steel, LEDs, HVAC | Genesis Facility only produces ceramics + robots | Critical |
| 5 | Zero human labor inside crop zones | Violates USDA/FDA audit rules | Critical |
| 6 | Sell ≥85% of greenhouses AND feed 21k–23.5k people | Mathematically impossible | Critical |
| 7 | $820–$920/m² turnkey | Above realistic 2025–2035 range of $580–$780/m² | Major |
| 8 | Full marine broodstock independence | Not commercially solved worldwide (2025) | Major |
| 9 | Total footprint = 3,932 ha | Ignores roads/energy buffers → should be 4,200–4,800 ha | Minor |

## Locked Realism Corrections – Version 1.1 (Binding)

1. **People fed per node** → **5,300–6,200 max**  
2. **Net exports** → Electricity export only in high-insolation zones; water export only in humid climates; **oxygen export deleted**  
3. **Circularity** → **≥98%** achievable  
4. **In-house manufacturing** → **≥92% of value** from Genesis ecosystem; steel, LEDs, HVAC remain third-party  
5. **Labor** → ≤10 FTE per node; zero routine labor retained only where legally permitted  
6. **Greenhouse sales cap** → External sales limited to **≤60%** to allow ≥4,800 people fed  
7. **Turnkey pricing** → **$680–$780/m²** realistic  
8. **Fish production** → Freshwater / brackish species only; marine salmon broodstock independence removed until ≥2045  
9. **Footprint** → **4,300 ± 400 ha** total
