# **Earth-Star Skyscraper Farm – Executive Summary (2032–2045)**

The Earth-Star Skyscraper Farm network is a **hybrid vertical + horizontal regenerative agriculture system** that integrates the Genesis Facility’s ceramic tiles and flat-pack kits into scalable, climate-resilient food, energy, and water production nodes. Each node supplies **20,000 people year-round** with USDA MyPlate diversity, generates renewable electricity and water, and creates additional revenue streams via nutraceuticals, cultured meat, bioproducts, and verified carbon credits. The horizontal component enables large-scale regenerative agriculture and accelerates **rewilding of >800 million acres** by 2045.

All systems are **commercially proven or in paid pilot as of November 2025**. No speculative processes are included.

**First node construction starts:** 2 January 2032  
**Full operational network (phase 1, 10 nodes):** 2038  
**Network expansion to 2045:** 40+ nodes nationwide
