# 1. Executive Summary (2032–2045 Buildout)

## Mission
Deploy a network of **20,000-person hybrid vertical + horizontal regenerative food, energy, and pharmaceutical production nodes**, achieving:

- **>10× land efficiency** vs 2025 U.S. agriculture  
- **Net-positive energy & water** after year 3  
- **Full USDA MyPlate diet** for 20,000 people per node  
- **Rewilding of >800M acres** by 2045 with node replication  
- **Dependence only on proven 2025 technologies**  
- **Full ceramic-tile structural envelopes** from Genesis factories  
- **Parallelizable permitting & construction**  
- **Use of on-site 3D printers** for ceramic modules  

Each node consists of:

- **One 150m × 150m vertical farm tower**  
- **2,065 hectares (5,100 acres)** of regenerative farmland  
- **Clear-tile greenhouses covering all crop zones**  
- **Agrivoltaic pastures**  
- **Full microgrid: solar, wind, biogas, geothermal**  
- **FDA-compliant cleanrooms for vitamins & simple APIs**
