   - ISO 5–8 ceramic cleanrooms (vitamins, botanical extracts, sterile hospital supplies)

2. **Horizontal Regenerative Zone (2,065 ha / 5,100 acres)**  
   - Calorie-dense crops (corn, soy, wheat, barley, sorghum)  
   - Orchard blocks (apples, citrus, stone fruit), nut groves

# 8. Feasibility Assessment (Aggressive but 100% Honest)

**Technically feasible:**  
All subsystems exist commercially in 2025 (CEA LEDs, aquaponics, AD-biogas CHP, geothermal HVAC, cultured meat pilots, silvopasture, virtual fencing).

**Financially feasible:**  
High-margin CEA + bioreactor protein + vertically integrated processing produces multi-hundred-million annual margins per node.

**Ecologically feasible:**  
- 98% water recycling (Singapore NEWater benchmarks)  
- Strong carbon negativity via biochar + soil restoration  
- Vertical farm displaces cropland → rewilding trajectory is achievable

**Regulatory feasibility:**  
- All outputs fit existing FDA/USDA frameworks  
- Cleanrooms sized for vitamins/APIs within 2025 GMP boundaries  
- No speculative biologics, no artificial wombs, no unproven energy tech  

**No physics violations. No prohibited technologies. All Prompt 2 constraints met.**
