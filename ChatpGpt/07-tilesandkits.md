## 4. Cost and Revenue Optimization Strategies

- **Reuse & Modularization**: Existing tiles, studs, and kits can be reconfigured for new districts, reducing CapEx by 30–50%.
- **Landfill Mining**: Reduces feedstock cost to near $0 for raw ceramics.
- **Automation**: 80–95% construction automation lowers labor costs.
- **Phased Deployment**: Floating, undersea, and land-based cities deployed in clusters to optimize logistics.
- **Energy & Water Integration**: Tiles generating energy and AWG reduce operational costs and create new revenue streams (sale of surplus energy, water, and carbon credits).
- **Smart Airlocks & Security**: Compliance with ISO 37122, NIST 800-53 ensures safety and lowers insurance cost.
