## Integration & Ecosystem Value
- Tile mesh primary → ultra-low power, local-first, sovereign  
- Cellular/GPS fallback → global coverage, emergency utility  
- Biosensor & location data feed personal/hub digital twins  
- Retail flywheel → badge adoption → tile/affiliate purchases  
- Off-world variant → radiation-hardened, lunar/Mars crew tracking

---

## Financial & Operational Impact
- Network-wide potential (2050 mature): $2.5–$10B/year (20–80M units)  
- Retail revenue (2035–2040): $0.8–$6B/year  
- Upsell flywheel: 10–25% of buyers convert to tile/affiliate purchases → +$0.5–$2B/year  
- Payback: 6–18 months (high-margin retail + ecosystem lock-in)

---

## Viability Notes
- Bridges personal use and Network infrastructure  
- RTK + GPS/cellular enable precision work, emergency response, global utility  
- Power management adaptive (tile mesh primary)  
- Privacy preserved via local processing & opt-in federation  
- Enhances human-centered design, adoption, and Network loyalty
