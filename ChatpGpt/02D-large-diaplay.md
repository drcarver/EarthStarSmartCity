# Prompt 02D – Genesis Network: Large-Scale Smart Display Walls  
**Interactive · WiFi-Enabled · Compute/Storage-Integrated · Self-Powered**

## Objective

Define the complete specification, manufacturing process, integration requirements, financial model, deployment strategy, and long-term viability of **large-scale smart display walls** constructed from **Smart Furniture Surface Tiles** (including outdoor-hardened variants).

These walls transform façades, plazas, retail fronts, tower exteriors, TerraWell centers, and public interiors into **interactive, revenue-generating, community-serving infrastructure**.

**Core goals**
- High-resolution, sunlight-readable, multi-user interactive displays  
- Free, secure public WiFi hotspots with isolated guest networking  
- Embedded, hot-swappable compute & storage for edge AI and federated learning  
- Near-zero grid dependency via BIPV solar + piezo harvesting + AWG cooling  
- Full Genesis Network integration (digital twins, sensor mesh, smart city standards)

- Throughput: 100–500 Mbps per 10 m² cluster
- Coverage radius: 50–150 m
- WPA3 guest isolation + captive portal

### Embedded Compute & Storage
- Hot-swappable pockets (100 × 100 × 10–15 mm)
- Compute: 16–64 core RISC-V, 1–10 TFLOPS / 10 m²
- Storage: 128 GB–16 TB per tile (NVMe / MRAM)
- Uses: Edge inference, caching, signage, federated learning

### Self-Powering & Cooling
- BIPV solar: 80–220 Wp/m²
- Piezo harvesting: 2–15 W/m²
- AWG condensate microchannel cooling: 50–150 W/m²
