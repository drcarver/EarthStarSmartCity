# Prompt 02D – Smart Display Walls (Recomputed)

## Objective
- Modular, snap-together display walls from **Smart Furniture Surface Tiles**  
- Self-powered: BIPV + piezo + AWG cooling  
- Embedded hot-swappable compute & storage for edge AI/federated learning  
- Multi-user interactive display with local AI queries  
- Public WiFi hotspots (secure, isolated)  
- Fully integrated with Genesis Network digital twins, hubs, and smart city standards  

---

## 1. Tile & Structural Specs
- **Tile Size**: 600 × 600 mm (up to 1200 × 1200 mm)  
- **Material**: Toughened ceramic composite (60–100+ MPa)  
- **Embedded**: Faraday mesh, blind-mate sockets, AWG microchannels, piezo layers  
- **Display Layer**: MicroLED/OLED, 4K–8K per 10 m² cluster, multi-touch + haptic  
- **Outdoor Variant**: IP67, UV-resistant, impact-resistant  
- **Mounting**: Snap-together magnetic + mechanical keying, blind-mate for all services

## 2. Integrated Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **Interactive AI Queries** | Small on-tile LLMs (Phi-2/TinyLlama quantized), federated queries to hub/regional twins, multi-modal input (touch/gesture/voice) |
| **Public WiFi Hotspots** | WiFi 6/6E/7 radios in 10–20% of tiles, 100–500 Mbps per 10 m², isolated guest networks |
| **Embedded Compute/Storage** | Hot-swappable modules (16–64 core RISC-V, 1–10 TFLOPS per 10 m²; 128 GB–16 TB NVMe/MRAM), workloads: inference, caching, federated learning, digital signage |
| **Self-Powering & Cooling** | BIPV 80–220 Wp/m², piezo 2–15 W/m², AWG microchannel cooling 50–150 W/m²; near-zero grid dependency |
| **Networking** | Inductive power 95–98% efficiency, mmWave/optical waveguide 10–100 Gbps, auto-discovery & topology formation |

## 3. Manufacturing & Materials
- **Production**: Tile Production Pods → permanent factories  
- **Inputs**: 70–95% waste-derived (C&D, RHA, farm/brownfield residues)  
- **Process**: Crush/mix → mold → display lamination → sensor embedding → firing → pocket + blind-mate integration → AI/vision QC  
- **Unit Cost (mature network)**: $335–$755/m² (full-featured wall)
