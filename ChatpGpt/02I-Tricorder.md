## Objective

Define the complete specification for a **tricorder-style handheld diagnostic scanner** within the Genesis Network. This device is a portable, multi-function tool combining vital sign monitoring, environmental sensing, threat detection, and imaging — inspired by Star Trek, grounded in **2026–2040 feasible technology**.

The tricorder is designed for:
- **First responders** (police, fire, EMS) as a primary field diagnostic and safety tool  
- **Individuals** for personal health and environmental awareness  
- Tight integration with the **Communicator Badge** for relay, alerts, and **digital twin** synchronization  

The device replaces or augments radios, body cams, and basic medical kits, while supporting **always-on operation** via inductive vehicle charging.

## Core Design Principles

- **Form Factor**: Handheld (phone-sized or slightly larger), ruggedized ceramic shell, IP67-equivalent  
- **Power**: Sodium-ion battery + piezo harvesting + inductive charging (vehicle docks)  
- **Processing**: Local-first RISC-V compute via OS & Software LLC; AI-assisted interpretation  
- **Connectivity**: Encrypted BLE / mmWave to Communicator Badge and tile mesh  
- **Modularity**: Snap-in probe modules (ultrasound, NIR, specialty sensors)
