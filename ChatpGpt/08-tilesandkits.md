## 4. Suggestions for Viability & Bottleneck Reduction

1. **Tile Production Scaling**: Preheat kilns using solar thermal and recover waste heat for LFP curing.  
2. **Inventory Optimization**: Centralized tile & kit factory scheduling reduces idle time and shipping bottlenecks.  
3. **Sensor Integration**: Standardized IoT nodes reduce calibration requirements, improve energy tracking, and simplify maintenance.  
4. **Airlock Automation**: Hyperspectral + AI reduces false positives and staffing costs.  
5. **Waste Feedstock Loop**: Maximize brownfield and landfill ceramic recovery for both tiles and foundation modules.  
6. **Energy Storage**: Concentrate LFP in foundation tiles, thin-film in façade for peak shaving; reduces overall cost.  
7. **Kit Reuse**: Modular design for hospitals, campuses, and Skyscraper Farms allows relocation and redeployment.  
8. **Regenerative Agriculture Integration**: Tiles, kits, and sensor systems harmonized for vertical/horizontal farms reduces downtime and increases yield predictability.
