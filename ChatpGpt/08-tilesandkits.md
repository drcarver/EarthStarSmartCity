## 1. Tile Catalogue

| Tile Code | Name | Composition | Manufacturing Process | Standard Area | Cost / Tile (USD) | Revenue / Tile (USD) | Notes |
|-----------|------|------------|----------------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------------|-------|
| T-01 | Standard Ceramic Panel | 92–95% Al₂O₃/SiC + 3–5% ZrO₂ | Press-mold → kiln → surface polish → embedded microchannels | 5 m² | 48 | 72 | Curtain wall, awning, facade cladding |
| T-02 | Clear Solar Tile | Same as T-01 + thin-film CIGS solar layer | Press-mold → CIGS deposition → kiln → embedded AWG microchannels | 5 m² | 65 | 95 | BIPV, integrates DC microgrid |
| T-03 | Stealth Ceramic | T-01 + radar-absorbing ceramic composites | Press-mold → composite embedding → kiln → precision machining | 5 m² | 72 | 120 | DoD/secure facilities only |
| T-04 | Transparent Bioreactor Tile | T-01 + UV-resistant polymer laminate | Press-mold → polymer lamination → quality test | 4 m² | 60 | 85 | Vertical farm aquaponics and aeroponics |
| T-05 | Smart Airlock Tile | T-01 + embedded IoT sensors | Press-mold → sensor embedding → kiln → calibration | 2 m² | 80 | 150 | Integrates facial recognition, weapons/explosive detection |

**Manufacturing Notes:**  
- All tiles fabricated at Genesis Facility using recycled feedstock: brownfields, demolished concrete, landfills, fly ash.  
- Tiles are non-structural; structural loads carried by steel/concrete frames.  
- Modular flat-pack design reduces construction time and logistical bottlenecks.
