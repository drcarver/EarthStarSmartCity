2. **Manufacturing pathways** (feedstocks, processes, cost per unit, revenue per unit)  
3. **Material compositions (validated 2025 only — no speculative graphene/CNT structural tiles)**  
4. **Smart airlock, security, and smart city compliance modules**  
5. **Detailed sensor handbook** covering environmental, security, structural, medical, agricultural, and industrial sensing  
6. **Viability improvements** reducing bottlenecks in tile production, feedstock supply, and kit assembly  
7. **Full cost/revenue recomputation** using aggressive but realistic margins  
8. **New kits added** where necessary based on Prompt 5–7 constraints
