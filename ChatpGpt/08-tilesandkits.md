## 1. Tiles Inventory

| Tile Type | Composition | Function | Size | Unit Cost (USD) | Annual Output (m²) | Revenue Potential (USD) |
|-----------|------------|---------|------|----------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Standard Ceramic | 92–95% Al₂O₃/SiC + 3–5% ZrO₂ | Cladding, curtain-wall | 1×1 m | 48 | 14.2B | 682M |
| Clear Ceramic | High-purity glass + minor binders | Greenhouse, solar glazing | 1×1 m | 62 | 1.5B | 93M |
| Stealth Ceramic | + Radar-absorbing composites | DoD façade & security | 1×1 m | 72 | 112M | 8.06M |
| Conductive Ceramic | Embedded Cu mesh | EMP shielding, IoT bus | 1×1 m | 65 | 400M | 26M |
| AWG Ceramic | Micro-channels for water | Rainwater & atmospheric capture | 1×1 m | 68 | 150M | 10.2M |
| Supercapacitor Tile | Thin embedded capacitor ≤1 kWh | Local energy storage | 1×1 m | 85 | 50M | 4.25M |

**Manufacturing:**  
- Input Sources: Landfill-derived glass, porcelain waste, fly ash, minor ZrO₂ & Al₂O₃ additives  
- Process: AI-controlled crushing → purification → molding → sintering → inspection → IoT embedding  
- Quality Control: Inline XRF, hyperspectral imaging, laser profilometry  
- Notes: All tiles non-structural; structural load carried by steel/concrete frame
