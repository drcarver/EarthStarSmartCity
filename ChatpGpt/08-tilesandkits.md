## 4. Manufacturing Process Overview

1. **Feedstock Collection** – Recycled C&D debris, glass, porcelain, fly ash, red mud, industrial tailings, copper and PV scraps.  
2. **Sorting & Preprocessing** – AI-assisted sorting, shredding, magnetic & eddy-current separation.  
3. **Mixing & Forming** – Ceramic powders blended with minor binders; pressed into molds or flat sheets.  
4. **Kiln Firing** – Standard industrial kilns, 1,000–1,250°C, depending on tile type.  
5. **Glazing / Lamination** – Optional BIPV, AWG microchannels, EMP mesh, supercapacitor deposition.  
6. **Quality Control** – Sensors integrated, stress & conductivity testing, ISO & building code compliance.  
7. **Packaging & Flat-Pack Assembly** – Kits combined with studs, connectors, and embedded sensors.

## 5. Cost & Revenue Recalculation Suggestions

- **Increase viability** by selling BIPV and AWG tiles as standalone renewable energy/water modules.  
- **Reduce bottlenecks** with pre-assembled smart airlocks and modular IoT sensor bundles.  
- **Re-use existing kits** across multiple building types to reduce CapEx.  
- **Diversify revenue** by offering license/subscription for remote monitoring of sensors and energy/water generation.  
- **Phase construction** to allow early revenue from high-margin industrial & vertical farm modules.

---

## 6. Key Recommendations for Bottleneck Mitigation

- **Feedstock contracts** with brownfields, C&D facilities, and industrial recyclers to avoid shortages.  
- **Parallel kit production** in multiple Genesis Facility lines to avoid single-point bottlenecks.  
- **Standardized sensor modules** across all tile types to simplify maintenance and reduce inventory complexity.  
- **Early automation** for vertical/horizontal farms and ceramic production to reduce labor dependency.  
- **Integrated energy + water + security management software** to optimize operational efficiency and compliance.
