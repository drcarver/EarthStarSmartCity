## 4. Viability Enhancements

- **Modular scalability:** Kit & tile standardization reduces production bottlenecks.  
- **Feedstock diversification:** Use brownfields, landfills, and demolition waste for tiles.  
- **Revenue optimization:**  
  - BIPV and AWG tiles generate additional utility revenue  
  - Skyscraper Farms and TerraFabs produce high-margin products from day one  
- **Risk mitigation:**  
  - Distributed kit assembly reduces supply chain single points of failure  
  - Redundant sensors ensure safety and security  
- **Cost optimization:**  
  - Shared tile stock across city, farm, and fab reduces per-unit production cost  
  - Airlocks and sensors integrated at kit level to avoid retrofits
