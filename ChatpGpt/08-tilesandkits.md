## 4. Cost & Revenue Summary

- **Tile Factory Cost / Revenue Assumptions (2025 USD)**

| Component | Unit Cost | Revenue Potential | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|------|
| Tiles | $15–$200 / m² | $28–$300 / m² | Based on size and integrated functions |
| Kits | $10k–$2.5M | $15k–$4M | Depends on scale and function |
| Sensors & Airlocks | $80k–$120k per kit | $120k–$150k | Adds security and smart city compliance |
| Marginal Factory Profit | 20–35% | – | Optimized via high-volume production and modular kit standardization |

**Revenue Enhancement Suggestions:**

- Prioritize early deployment of high-margin kits (Skyscraper Farms, industrial, compliance kits).  
- Reuse existing tiles across multiple projects to reduce lead times.  
- Expand sensor offerings for ESG reporting (carbon monitoring, water savings) to monetize credits.  
- Integrate BIPV and AWG outputs into grid/utility revenue streams.

## 5. Viability Enhancements / Bottleneck Reduction

- **Feedstock:** Centralized AI sorting + pyrolysis ensures steady tile input; multiple brownfield/landfill sources reduce risk.  
- **Factory Scale:** Modular factory design allows 2–3x scaling without retooling.  
- **Logistics:** Flat-pack kits reduce shipping cost, improve build speed.  
- **Smart Integration:** IoT + energy/water monitoring enables predictive maintenance and operational efficiency.  
- **Self-Funding:** High-margin kit sales (industrial, compliance, Skyscraper Farms) accelerate cash flow, reducing dependence on public funding.
