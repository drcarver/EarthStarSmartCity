## 1. Executive Summary (Viability-Optimized)

**TerraFab** is a **co-located, phased, closed-loop manufacturing extension of the Genesis System**, designed to produce:

- Advanced AI and edge semiconductors
- Highly automated mini-fabs for sensors and control electronics
- Medical devices, hospital equipment, and assistive mobility systems
- Pharmaceuticals (APIs, generics, OTC drugs) not viable on-farm
- Robotics, drones, and DC appliances

TerraFab **does not precede Genesis**. It begins only after Genesis hubs demonstrate:
- Stable food, power, water, and materials closure
- Positive free cash flow
- Operational AI + compliance portals

This sequencing **eliminates existential risk** and ensures TerraFab grows only as demand, revenue, and internal supply capacity justify.

---

## 2. Strategic Viability Enhancements (Changes Made)

To maximize feasibility and regulatory success:

- **Advanced-node chips phased realistically**
  - Early: 28–65 nm (edge AI, power electronics, sensors)
  - Mid: 14–7 nm via partnerships + tool reuse
  - Leading-edge AI accelerators: JV, licensing, or chiplet integration
- **Mini-fabs prioritized before full TerraFab**
- **Medical manufacturing separated by cleanroom class**
- **APIs & drugs limited to generics with stable chemistry**
- **Stealth/military variants isolated in separate secured fabs**
- **Commercial lithography tools acquired/refurbished**, not reinvented
- **AI limited to process optimization and compliance**, not autonomous control
- **All equipment designed as modular flat-pack kits**
- **Compliance instrumentation embedded by design**

No part of TerraFab depends on speculative physics or regulatory exceptions.
