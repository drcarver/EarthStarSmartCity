# Earth-Star Industries National Transformation Strategy – MHUE-50k Rollout  
**First city construction start:** 2 January 2035 • **Base case full national build-out:** 2095  
**Aggressive case full national build-out:** 2075  
**All technology commercially proven as of November 2025**

## Executive Summary

Earth-Star Industries will execute a 60-year U.S. transformation leveraging the Genesis Facility ceramic tile/kit supply chain to:

- House and feed 360–400 million Americans in 7,200 MHUE-50k-class smart city districts  
- Replace 100 % of conventional U.S. agriculture with 9,300 hybrid Skyscraper Farm nodes  
- Rewild 720 million acres of freed cropland and pasture  
- Remediate 4,800 Superfund/brownfield sites and 5,200 closed landfills as tile feedstock  
- Build 82,000 miles of 220 mph High-Speed Rail along existing freight ROW using recycled ceramic-concrete slab  
- Upgrade or replace 180 non-strategic military bases and provide stealth façades for 80 critical DoD facilities  
- Achieve >97 % material closure and marginal construction cost ~$6,000–$8,000/person after 2065

All construction uses Genesis Facility tiles, studs, and flat-pack kits. Functional equipment uses standard 2025–2095 commercial systems inside ceramic shells.
