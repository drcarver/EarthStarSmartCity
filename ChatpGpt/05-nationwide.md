# Earth-Star Industries – National Transformation Strategy

**Start Date:** 2 January 2035  
**Scope:** Full U.S. transformation with phased MHUE-50k city, farm, and industrial network deployment.

---

# 1. Core Mission

Earth-Star Industries aims to:

- House and feed **360–400 million Americans** in **7,200 MHUE-50k smart city districts**  
- Deploy **9,300 hybrid Skyscraper Farm nodes** to replace 100% U.S. agriculture  
- Rewild **720 million acres** of freed cropland and pasture  
- Remediate **4,800 Superfund/brownfield sites** and **5,200 closed landfills** for ceramic feedstock  
- Build **82,000 miles of 220 mph High-Speed Rail (HSR)** on recycled ceramic-concrete slab  
- Upgrade or replace **180 military bases**, stealth-facade **80 critical DoD facilities**  
- Achieve **>97% material closure** and per-capita construction costs approaching $6–8k after 2065  
- Provide **pods and assisted-living solutions** for seniors and non-city dwellers  
- Co-locate all cities with **Genesis factories, TerraFabs, and farms**  
- Include TerraWell humanitarian layer for universal healthcare and food distribution
