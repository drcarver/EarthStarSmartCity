## Executive Overview

The Genesis Network now supplies:

- **Grocery stores** – all aisles, fresh/frozen/pantry/processed  
- **Liquor stores** – beer, cider, bio-spirits, mixers  
- **Home & Garden centers** – live plants, seedlings, fertilizers, ceramic tools, pest control  

Key capabilities:

- Staggered cycles for **year-round reliable supply**  
- Agroforestry/orchard canopies → **+30–70% fruit/nut/plant output**  
- Biorefinery/processing pods → value-added products  
- Brewery/bakery/confectionary pods → processed goods for retail  
- TerraWell FreeCare → community integration & demand pull  
- Microbial boosts & dense sensor nets → yield/cost efficiency  

Maximum per **mature hub** (1,200 ha):

- 100–300 grocery stores  
- 50–200 liquor stores  
- 30–150 home/garden centers  

Network-wide (2040s mature): 300,000–1,000,000+ retail locations.

## Phased Rollout (Maximum Coverage)

| Phase | Timeline | Max Stores per Hub (Grocery + Liquor + Home/Garden) | Additional CAPEX ($B network-wide) | Revenue Uplift ($B/year) |
|-------|---------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Phase 1 – Core | 2027–2030 | 20–80 + 20–80 + 10–50 | 0.15–0.45 | +0.8–3.0 |
| Phase 2 – Scaled | 2031–2035 | 50–150 + 50–150 + 20–80 | 0.6–1.8 | +3.0–10.0 |
| Phase 3 – Maximum | 2036–2045 | 100–300 + 50–200 + 30–150 | 1.2–3.6 | +8.0–25.0+ |

**Total Additional CAPEX**: $2.0–$6.0B network-wide  
**ROI**: <3 years  
**Network IRR**: 48–84%  
**NPV (7% discount, 2076 horizon)**: $2.2–$8.0T

## Viability & Strategic Rationale

- **Steady Supply**: Staggered cycles + orchard canopies → predictable deliveries, 20–50% lower wholesale prices  
- **High-Margin Categories**: Liquor (bio-spirits) + Home/Garden (organic amendments) → 65–85% margins  
- **Community Integration**: TerraWell FreeCare absorbs surplus → builds demand → retail pull  
- **Political/Social Armor**: Supplies local food, beverages, and gardening needs → strengthens rural/economic narrative  
- **Bottom Line**: Diversifies revenue, accelerates self-funding, deepens network resilience
