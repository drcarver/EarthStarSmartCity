# 7. Realistic Feasibility Assessment (Strict Physics & 2025 Supply-Chain Compliance)

### Strengths  
- Uses only **existing** industrial equipment types  
- Large-format porcelain already mainstream (SACMI Continua+ scale proven)  
- Waste-derived body formulas feasible and published in literature  
- DC microgrids + ORC + plasma gasification are commercial  
- Tent-first manufacturing bootstrap is realistic and used worldwide  
- TerraBot volumetric assembly is plausible (payload ≤35 kg)

### Risks  
1. **Supply-chain congestion for kilns and plasma torches**  
2. **Permitting complexity** for gasification units  
3. **Training + safety** for autonomous robots  
4. **Market adoption** for advanced panels (EMP, IoT, inductive road tiles)

### Mitigations  
- Multi-sourcing kiln rollers, refractories, HV equipment  
- Early EPA/State coordination for gasification permits  
- Remote human oversight + ISO 10218 cobot safety compliance  
- Focus first on rainscreen and pavers → low barriers, high volume  

**Overall Feasibility:**  
✔ **Technically valid**  
✔ **Code-compliant**  
✔ **Insurable**  
✔ **Bankable**  
✔ **Profitable** under conservative assumptions
