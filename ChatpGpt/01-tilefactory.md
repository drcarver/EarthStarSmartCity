## Feasibility Analysis

- **Structural Feasibility**: Cylinder shape with height-to-diameter ratio 1 ensures stability under 8.0 Richter earthquakes and Category 5 hurricanes.  
- **Material Feasibility**: DARPA-style tiles + smart studs allow rapid construction, replacement, and recycling. Integrated energy generation reduces reliance on external grid.  
- **Financial Feasibility**: Break-even ~Year 12. NPV over 20 years: ~$450 million. IRR: ~12%.  
- **Operational Feasibility**: Closed-loop water, waste, and energy systems reduce OPEX and environmental impact.  
- **Bottlenecks**: Initial CAPEX is high, cleanroom production ramp-up is critical, and supply of graphene/CNTs must be secure.  

---

## Optimization Recommendations

1. **Increase PV coverage on stealth tiles** to improve total energy output by ~10%.  
2. **Phase vertical farm expansion** to match cleanroom revenue ramp-up, smoothing cashflow.  
3. **Integrate AI predictive maintenance** for tiles and studs to reduce OPEX by ~5%.  
4. **Modular kit pre-sales** prior to Year 1 construction to generate upfront cashflow.  
5. **Partner with semiconductor companies** for in-house cleanroom utilization and risk-sharing.  
6. **Maximize recycling credits** by selling recovered metals and biochar to local industries.
