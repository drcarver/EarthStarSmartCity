# Executive Summary – Genesis Facility Option B

**Project Start Date:** 2 January 2027  
**Project Mission:** Build the first Genesis Facility, a circular-materials megafactory producing 30M m²/year of waste-derived ceramic tiles and panels while remediating municipal, industrial, and C&D waste, generating energy, and providing materials for downstream Earth-Star projects.  

**Key Highlights:**
- Fully automated, modular flat-pack factory with TerraBot™ assembly robots.
- 100% waste-derived ceramic production, including advanced functional panels (BIPV, EMP-shielded, AWG, IoT-enabled).
- Net energy exporter via optimized plasma gasification + CHP + ORC recovery.
- Bankable and fully compliant with 2025 engineering standards, U.S. codes, and international sustainability standards.
- Phase 0 tent campus (2027–2029) generates revenue immediately, accelerating NPV and IRR.
