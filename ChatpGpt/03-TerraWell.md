## Executive Summary

The **TerraWell FreeCare System** is a fully independent, privately funded **501(c)(3) nonprofit** operated by the **TerraWell Foundation**, designed to deliver **free food, essential goods, and medical support** to underserved populations at national scale while maintaining strict legal and operational separation from **EarthStar Technologies** and its for-profit **Genesis System**.
