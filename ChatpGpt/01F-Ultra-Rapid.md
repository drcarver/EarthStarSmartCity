## Purpose

Define the **strict, auditable, non-negotiable requirements** a Genesis hub must meet before it is authorized to act as a **Mother Hub** capable of:

- Seeding new core hubs (500–2,500 ha)
- Seeding affiliate mini-hubs (5–60 ha)
- Supplying live biology, feedstock, pods, and trained operators
- Transferring reputation, governance trust, and operational legitimacy

**No hub may seed another hub unless it passes *every* requirement below.**  
No provisional, partial, or political approvals are permitted.

---

## Core Doctrine

- **Seeding is a privilege, not a milestone**
- **Velocity without resilience is forbidden**
- **Biology, cashflow, and governance must be independently survivable**
- **Abort authority overrides growth incentives**

---

## Qualification Categories (All Mandatory)

A hub must pass **100% of gates** in all six categories:

1. Operational Maturity  
2. Financial Resilience  
3. Biology & Closure Performance  
4. Supply Chain & Manufacturing Readiness  
5. Governance, Reputation & Compliance  
6. Seeding Capacity & Risk Containment  

Failure in **any single gate** → **Immediate disqualification** or **loss of Mother Hub status**.

---

## 1. Operational Maturity Gates

| Requirement | Threshold | Verification |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| Continuous operation | ≥ 9 consecutive months | Ops logs, sensor history |
| Pod uptime | ≥ 96% average uptime | Independent audit |
| Emergency response drills | ≥ 2 full simulations completed | Drill reports |
| Staff redundancy | ≥ 2 trained operators per pod type | Training records |
| Relocation readiness | 100% pods relocatable within 30 days | Dry-run documentation |

**Kill-switch:** Any unplanned full-system outage >24h in last 90 days.

---

## 2. Financial Resilience Gates

| Requirement | Threshold |
|------------|----------|
| Cash-positive duration | ≥ 6 consecutive months |
| Revenue diversity | ≥ 5 independent streams |
| Largest revenue stream | ≤ 35% of total |
| Operating reserve | ≥ 3 months full opex |
| Debt service coverage | ≥ 2.0x |
| Conservative model validation | Actuals ≥ conservative baseline |

**Disallowed:**  
- Subsidy dependence  
- Bridge financing to meet reserves  
- Deferred payroll or vendor arrears  

**Kill-switch:** Any month with negative operating cashflow after qualification.

---

## 3. Biology & Closure Performance Gates

| Metric | Threshold |
|------|-----------|
| Overall resource closure | ≥ 95% sustained 90 days |
| Water closure | ≥ 90% (AWG + rain + reuse) |
| Energy closure | ≥ 100% net-positive |
| Biology survival rate | ≥ 97% quarterly |
| Disease incidents | Zero uncontrolled outbreaks |
| Frozen master banks | 100% species coverage |

**Mandatory Proof:**
- Live sensor feeds (water, DO, ammonia, methane, energy)
- Third-party animal welfare & biosecurity audit
- Independent biologist sign-off

**Kill-switch:**  
- Any mass mortality event (>5% species loss)  
- Any undocumented pathogen outbreak  

---

## 4. Supply Chain & Manufacturing Readiness Gates

| Requirement | Threshold |
|------------|----------|
| Dual sourcing | 100% pod-critical components |
| Critical parts buffer | ≥ 6 months |
| Tile & pipe yield | ≥ 85% QA pass rate |
| Ceramic feedstock stockpile | ≥ 90 days |
| Biology transport success | ≥ 85% survival historical |
| Logistics redundancy | ≥ 2 carriers + routes |

**Disallowed:**  
- Single-vendor GNSS, battery, SoC, or actuator dependency  
- Just-in-time biology sourcing  

**Kill-switch:** Loss of dual sourcing for any critical component.

---

## 5. Governance, Reputation & Compliance Gates

| Requirement | Threshold |
|------------|----------|
| Cooperative charter | Filed, binding, public |
| Independent board seats | ≥ 2 non-management |
| Audit cadence | Quarterly, published summaries |
| Public sensor dashboard | Live, no manual suppression |
| Neighbor agreements | ≥ 80% compliance maintained |
| Incident response SLA | <12h public disclosure |

**Mandatory Teams Active:**
- Legal counsel (ag + zoning)
- PR / crisis response
- Biosecurity officer

**Kill-switch:**  
- Any attempt to conceal incidents  
- Regulatory violation without self-reporting  

---

## 6. Seeding Capacity & Risk Containment Gates

| Requirement | Threshold |
|------------|----------|
| Excess output available | 10–20% sustained |
| Frozen biology reserve | ≥ 2 full hub equivalents |
| Live biology buffer | ≥ 30 days |
| Transport hardening | Dual-route + climate telemetry |
| Seeding cadence limit | ≤ 1 core hub / 90 days |
| Regional concurrency cap | ≤ 2 launches / climate zone |

**Mandatory Rule:**  
A Mother Hub **may not seed** if doing so would reduce its own closure, reserves, or staffing below minimum thresholds.

---

## Authority & Enforcement

- **Mother Hub Ops Council** (external to site) holds:
  - Qualification approval authority  
  - Suspension authority  
  - Immediate abort authority  

- Site leadership **cannot override**:
  - Biology viability aborts  
  - Financial reserve breaches  
  - Governance kill-switches  

---

## Loss of Mother Hub Status

Status is **automatically revoked** upon:

- Any kill-switch trigger
- Two or more gate warnings in 90 days
- Failure to publish audits or dashboards on schedule

Requalification requires:
- Full corrective action report (CAR)
- 90 days clean operation post-fix
- Independent re-audit

---

## Strategic Rationale

This specification ensures that:
- Failure cannot cascade network-wide
- Growth pressure never overrides survivability
- Reputation remains an asset, not a liability
- Biology and trust are treated as scarce, high-value resources

Mother Hubs are **infrastructure of last resort**, not growth trophies.
