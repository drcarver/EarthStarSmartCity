## Executive Overview

The **Security & Surveillance LLC** delivers a **layered, AI-native security ecosystem** for Genesis hubs, affiliate farms, smart cities, and external clients. It combines **sensor-dense tiles**, **autonomous surveillance pods**, **drone integration**, **biometric and access control**, and **dedicated trace detection** (weapons, explosives, narcotics) into turnkey deployments with strong regulatory alignment and **high-margin recurring contracts**.

The system is designed to be:
- **Pod- and tile-native** (snap-in, mobile, scalable)
- **Lights-out capable** with human-in-the-loop escalation
- **Local-first** for privacy, with optional federated analytics
- **Dual-use** (internal Genesis resilience + external commercial/government markets)

Project phase targets **Phase 2 (2029–2031)**, aligning with hub scaling and early city/affiliate adoption.
