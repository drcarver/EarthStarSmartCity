## 2. Viability Analysis

| Factor | Assessment | Aggressive Mitigation / Enhancement |
|--------|------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Cost Efficiency** | Tiles sourced from recycled landfills, automated labor reduces OPEX | Expand landfill mining, brownfield site use to reduce CapEx |
| **Revenue Streams** | Food, pharmaceuticals, energy, industrial production, hyperloop, carbon credits | Monetize vertical farm output, waste-to-energy, renewable energy certificates |
| **Automation & Labor** | High automation reduces human labor dependency | Implement AI-managed airlocks, smart sensors, and modular maintenance kits |
| **Energy Sustainability** | Skyscraper farms with agrivoltaics, geothermal, methane turbines | Maximize energy self-sufficiency, feed excess into national grid |
| **Water Management** | Closed-loop aquaponics, AWGs, greywater reuse | Integrate horizontal farms for additional water capture, methane-H₂O recycling |
| **Food Security** | Vertical farms, livestock, aquaculture, orchards | Diverse crops, plant-based & cultured meats, permaculture integration |
| **Regulatory Compliance** | Full adherence to smart city, military, environmental, and ISO standards | Aggressive early engagement with regulators, ISO/NIST-certified cleanrooms |
| **Disaster Resilience** | Domed city structures, reinforced ceramics | Add modular emergency units, decentralized energy storage, underground reserves |
| **Scalability** | From pilot district to national coverage | Phased build: pilot → brownfield expansion → rural scaling → national integration |
| **Environmental Impact** | Restoration of 1.5B acres, ocean remediation | Prioritize high-biodiversity regions, generate carbon credits, integrate urban green spaces |
