## Executive Summary

This package consolidates the **critical enhancements** across regulatory, political, operational, and supply chain domains to **increase the Genesis Network’s base-case success probability from ~20–32% to ~28–45%+**. Implementation focuses on **low-regret, realistic interventions** during the 2026–2030 bootstrap phase, leveraging existing assets (tiles, pods, badges, RTK network, TerraWell) and minimizing new dependencies.
