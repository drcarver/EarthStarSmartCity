## 4. Suggestions to Enhance Viability & Reduce Bottlenecks

1. **Standardization**: Maximize reuse of tiles across multiple kits to reduce inventory complexity.  
2. **Early Cash-Flow Kits**: Prioritize K-02 (vertical farm) and K-04 (TerraFab) to generate early revenue.  
3. **Automation**: Use robotic assembly and 3D printing to accelerate construction and reduce labor costs.  
4. **Integrated Sensors**: Smart airlocks and monitoring improve security while reducing personnel cost.  
5. **Batch Production**: Scale Genesis tile production to meet multiple city orders simultaneously to avoid bottlenecks.  
6. **Energy Integration**: DC microgrid kits (K-07) paired with BIPV tiles (T-03) to maximize renewable power and reduce dependency on external grid.  
7. **Recycling**: Tiles and panels at end-of-life fed back into Genesis facilities to reduce material costs.  
8. **International Licensing**: Use modular kits (K-01 to K-09) for licensing overseas construction to reduce upfront capital needs.

## 5. Manufacturing & Supply Notes

- **Tile Manufacturing**: High-temperature kilns, CNC cutting, automated assembly lines. All inputs sourced from recycled porcelain, fly ash, and post-consumer glass.  
- **Kit Assembly**: Factory-preassembled flat-pack modules shipped to construction sites; modular design allows phased construction.  
- **Cost Management**: Standardized components reduce manufacturing complexity, allow bulk procurement, and minimize shipping volume.
