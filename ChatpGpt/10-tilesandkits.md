# Genesis Network — Complete Tile & Kit Catalog  
**Earth-Star Industries**

This document enumerates **all tiles and flat-pack kits required to construct the Genesis Network**, assuming:

- **All structures use tiles, ceramics, and kits only**
- **All tiles and kits originate from Genesis Tile Factories**
- **No conventional steel/concrete framing except recycled aggregate bases**
- **Full smart-city compliance**
- **Integrated security, sensors, and sustainable building codes**
- **Rapid self-funding priority**

The design emphasizes **manufacturability, modularity, recycling, automation, and political viability**.

## 1. Genesis Tile Manufacturing Overview

### Tile Factory Inputs (Primary Sources)

| Input Source | Origin |
|-------------|--------|
| Demolition concrete & asphalt | Brownfields, roads, dams |
| Industrial slag & ash | Steel mills, power plants |
| Glass waste | Municipal recycling |

### Core Manufacturing Process

1. **Sorting & Crushing** (mobile + fixed)
2. **Plasma Vitrification** (waste → ceramic slag)
3. **Ceramic Blending** (slag + silica + biochar)
4. **Tile Forming** (extrusion / pressing / 3D ceramic printing)
5. **Sintering / Kilns** (electric + waste heat)
6. **Embedded Layering**:
   - Power conduits
   - Data fiber
   - Sensor meshes
7. **Final Surface Treatments**
8. **QA + Sensor Calibration**
