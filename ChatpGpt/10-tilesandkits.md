## 5. Viability Enhancement Suggestions

1. **Parallel Manufacturing:** Tile & kit production should be split into multiple lines to avoid bottlenecks.
2. **Recycling Integration:** All demolished structures feed ceramic/plastic aggregates back into factory lines.
3. **Automation:** Robotics-assisted assembly reduces labor constraints, improves quality.
4. **Short-Cycle Pilots:** Early testing of vertical farms, DAC, microbial kits in Innovation Hub before full deployment.
5. **Revenue Maximization:** High-margin kits (TerraFab, airlocks, vertical farms) prioritized for early sales to fund slower-return items.
6. **Redundant Supply Chains:** Multiple factories per region mitigate risk of natural disaster or political disruption.
7. **Smart City Integration:** Full sensor dashboards with AI-driven anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, and automated alerting.
