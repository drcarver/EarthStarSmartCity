## 5. Suggestions Implemented to Enhance Viability

- **Parallel production of kits and tiles** to reduce lead times.
- **Reuse of kit components** to lower CAPEX and OPEX.
- **Data moat integration**: all sensor and production data feed back into R&D for faster iteration.
- **Modular LLC structure**: failure of a single kit/product does not compromise whole system.
- **Smart airlocks and threat detection** standard across all hubs for security compliance.
- **Compliance with sustainable building codes**, ISO 37120/ISO 14001.
- **Energy/water/carbon metrics** feed into revenue projections via carbon credits and operational savings.
- **Global kit standardization** where possible, with regional replacement for cultural/religious adaptation.
