## 1. Executive Summary (Viability-Optimized & Honest)

The **Genesis + TerraFab System** is a phased, modular, closed-loop industrial ecosystem designed to achieve **national food, energy, water, housing, healthcare, and advanced manufacturing independence**, with surplus for export and large-scale rewilding.

### Core Viability Improvements (Integrated Across All Prompts)

To maximize real-world feasibility, the following changes are now **explicitly locked in**:

1. **Farm-First, Revenue-First Rule**  
   - No cities, fabs, or hospitals are built until **food, biogas, and greenhouse revenue is live**.
   - Genesis always precedes TerraFab.

2. **Strict Technology Tiering**  
   - Mini-fabs (65–180 nm) first  
   - Mid-tier fabs (28–65 nm) second  
   - Full advanced TerraFab only where justified  
   - No early EUV arms race

3. **Regulatory Load Control**  
   - DC grids limited to private land  
   - Early phases avoid landfill mining, controlled substances, and high-risk permitting  
   - FDA/CHIPS/OSHA compliance handled via **sensorized digital audit trails**, not paperwork labor

4. **Capital Discipline**  
   - Virgin materials allowed early  
   - Leased tents + leased equipment for first tile factories  
   - Grants used only to accelerate, never to survive

5. **Automation Reality Check**  
   - “Lights-out” is phased, not assumed  
   - Telepresence is mandatory fallback  
   - Human override always preserved

6. **TerraFab Scope Narrowed for Survival**  
   - Focus on sensors, power electronics, edge compute, medical devices, and generics  
   - Advanced AI chips only where margins justify capex

These constraints **increase viability**, reduce regulatory and capital risk, and preserve the long-term vision without speculative assumptions.
