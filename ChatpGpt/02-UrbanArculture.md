## Introduction

The **Earth-Star Industries Sustainable Urban Agriculture System Kit** is a **household-scale, closed-loop solution** designed for U.S. urban households (e.g., Seattle or Miami), supporting **4–6 people**. Built entirely from **enhanced ceramic tiles, smart studs, and modular kits** sourced from Earth-Star tile factories, the kit integrates:

- Waste management  
- Water recycling  
- Energy generation  
- Food production  
- Recreational amenities (pool, hot tub, sauna, outdoor kitchen)  

The system occupies a **300–500 ft² sunroom**, aligns with **green building codes** (LEED Gold, ASHRAE 90.1, ICC 500), and integrates **ISO 37122 smart city standards** with **smart airlocks** (weapon/explosive scanning, AI facial recognition).

## Components

### Bio-Digester
- Processes **2 kg/day organic waste** into **0.2–0.5 m³/day biogas** (1–2 kWh) and **10–12 kg/day digestate**.  
- 120–180 enhanced ceramic tiles form sealed tanks.  
- **Outputs**: Fertilizer + fuel for biogas stove/generator.

### Atmospheric Water Generators (AWGs)
- **3 units** (500W each) using 30 ceramic tiles.  
- Captures **15–45 L/day** from air/pool humidity.  
- Supplies farming, pool, sauna, and kitchen.

### Greywater Processing
- Treats **50–100 L/day** from sinks, showers, laundry.  
- 20 tiles with **graphene pipes** (from Stud Kits).  
- Provides reuse water for aquaponics and vertical farming.

### Aquaponics
- 500–1,000 L ceramic tanks (30–60 tiles).  
- Produces **10–20 kg fish/year** and **50–100 kg crops/year**.  
- Waste cycles to vertical farming.

### Vertical Farming
- 50–100 tiles in aeroponic towers.  
- Produces **100–500 kg/year crops**.  
- Uses digestate and aquaponics nutrients.

### Algae Bioreactors
- 100–200 L tanks (10–20 tiles).  
- Captures **0.1–0.3 kg/day CO₂**.  
- Produces biomass for fertilizer/fish feed.

- Ceramic compactor (20 tiles).  
- Processes **1–2 kg/day MSW** into tiles + water.  
- Supplies **0.1–0.2 kg/day tiles**.

### Waste-to-Energy (WTE)
- Ceramic furnace (15 tiles).  
- Generates **0.2–0.9 kWh/day electricity** or **0.5–3 kWh/day heat**.  
- Ash disposal minimal (**0.1–0.2 kg/day**).

### Sunroom
- 300–500 ft² structure with **560–920 tiles**.  
- Houses aquaponics, vertical farms, pool, hot tub, sauna.  
- Includes **100 clear PV tiles** for windows.  
- Smart airlock for security.

### Outdoor Kitchen
- 180–360 tiles, biogas stove, dining area.  
- Greywater sink integrated.  
- Smart airlock entry.

| Biogas       | 1–2 kWh/day        |
| WTE          | 0.2–0.9 kWh/day    |

### HVAC / Heat Pump
- 20 tiles with **combined heating/cooling**.  
- Maintains **20–30°C, 60–80% RH**.  

### Automation
- 100 IoT sensors per tile (AES-256).  
- Controls **temperature, CO₂, pH, nutrients, waste**.  
- **95% automation**, 5% human oversight.

### Odor Control
- 10 tiles with carbon scrubbers.  
- Sealed digester/TCPS/WTE ensure **urban compatibility**.

## System Integration

The system achieves **85–95% closure**:

- **Waste**: 90–95% processed into energy/tiles.  
- **Water**: 95–98% recycled.  
- **Nutrients**: 80–90% reused in farming.  
- **Energy**: 95–98% renewable/onsite.  
- **Carbon**: 80–90% captured via algae.
