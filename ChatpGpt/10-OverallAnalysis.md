## 2. Reward / Impact Overview

| Metric                               | Base Case (2095)        | Aggressive (2075–2084) | Notes |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-------|
| Population Housed                     | 243 million (5,800 cities) | 280 million (6,500 cities) | Fully self-sustaining urban districts |
| Agricultural Replacement              | 100 % U.S. coverage (15,800 Skyscraper Farms) | Accelerated 2–3 years | 15–20× land efficiency |
| Acres Rewilded                        | 620 M (US) + 480 M (Intl) | 700 M + 500 M | Environmental restoration |
| High-Speed Rail                        | 28,000 miles           | 33,000 miles           | Using existing ROW, 220–250 mph |
| Public Funding Share                  | 49.5 %                 | 50–52 %                | IIJA / IRA / CHIPS + successors |
| Whole-programme NPV                    | $21.4 T                | $23–24 T               | Conservative discount at 8% |
| Cumulative Private + Royalty Cash Flow| $6.71 T                | $7.2 T                 | Proprietary kits and royalties |
| Composite Probability of Success       | 86–90 %                | 68–74 % (aggressive)  | Includes technical + political risks |

## 3. Cost vs Benefit Visual Summary

| Category                   | Base Case Cost (USD T) | Base Case Benefit / Revenue (USD T) | Notes |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|-------|
| Genesis Facility + 11 Intl Factories | 0.81 | 6.71 (royalties & proprietary kits) | Payback via kit licensing |
| Skyscraper Farms / Agriculture      | 1.2  | Food + pharma + carbon credits | 15–20× land efficiency |
| Cities & Infrastructure             | 2.8  | Taxes + services + property sales | MHUE-50k replication model |
| High-Speed Rail                     | 0.35 | Transport + efficiency gains | 28,000 miles only |
| Military / Stealth Upgrades        | 0.35 | Strategic value & DoD funding | Fully funded by MILCON |
| **Total**                           | **4.81** | **6.71+** | Conservative estimate |

## 4. Key Takeaways

1. **High Reward / Moderate Risk:** Even with political, industrial, or natural shocks, the program’s **modular design and redundancies** keep population and infrastructure survivable.  
2. **Phased Rollout Critical:** Executing Genesis Facility → MHUE-50k → National → Global sequence reduces compounding risk.  
3. **Material Circularity & Sustainability:** Use of brownfields and landfills for tile production provides a continuous feedstock, reducing bottlenecks and dependency on raw mining.  
4. **Financial Feasibility:** Public/private funding balance ensures **near-term cash flow sufficiency**; royalties from proprietary kits create **long-term revenue stream**.  
5. **Extreme Event Preparedness:** Earth-Star cities remain habitable in extreme scenarios (nuclear winter, asteroid strikes, supervolcano) due to **ceramic construction, smart airlocks, and indoor self-sufficiency systems**.
