# Genesis Network Website Index

## Introduction

This index provides a comprehensive structure for a website dedicated to the Genesis Network project by Earth-Star Industries. It organizes content into logical sections, including project overviews, feasibility analyses, expansion plans, component catalogs, and financial summaries. Each entry includes a brief description and links to hypothetical pages (use as anchors or file names in a GitHub Pages repo). Financials are encapsulated in dedicated markdown segments for clarity.

## Table of Contents

1. **[Home](web/home.md)**: Project mission, executive summary, and key viability metrics (e.g., IRR 35–45%, NPV $11T by 2050).
2. **[Project Overview](web/overview.md)**: Detailed description of regenerative hubs, pod-centric architecture, and core principles (closed-loop 95–99%, farmer empowerment).
3. **[Innovation Hub LLCs](web/llcs.md)**: List of 19 LLCs (e.g., Ceramics Production, TerraFab) with roles and risk mitigation benefits.
4. **[Tiles, Pods, and Kits Catalog](web/catalog.md)**: Comprehensive lists with manufacturing, inputs, materials, costs ($1.6–5/ft² for tiles; $75–150K/pod), and revenues ($4.8–14/ft²; $400K–1.2M/year/pod).
5. **[Sensor Handbook](web/sensors.md)**: Detailed guide to sensor types, applications, specs, and costs ($30–300/unit), with redundancy and AI integration.
6. **[Resilience Analysis](web/resilience.md)**: Evaluation of disaster resilience (natural/man-made, nuclear/pandemic; ratings 6–9/10).
7. **[50-Year Roadmap](web/roadmap.md)**: Phased timeline (2026–2076) with NASA/ISS tech integrations, feedback loops, and financials (cumulative cash flow +$1M+ by 2076).
8. **[Feasibility Analyses](web/feasibility.md)**: Aggressive assessments (overall 8.5/10), top 10 risks/mitigations/quick wins, and space expansion viability.
9. **[Expansion Plans](web/expansion.md)**: Western Hemisphere ("Fortress West"), global rollout, and space pivot (Luna/Mars/asteroids/cylinders/probes) with LLC estimates by region/country.
10. **[Financial Summaries](web/financials.md)**: Encapsulated markdown segments below, including recalculated costs, revenues, timelines, NPV, IRR, and break-even.

## Financial Summaries

### Overall Project Financials
- **CAPEX Ramp**: $0.2B (2027) → $40B/year (2050); total $5–10T by 2076 (space-inclusive).
- **Revenue Ramp**: $0.3B (2027) → $3,700B (2050) → $100K+ B/year (2076); drivers: Produce/tiles (40%), electronics/gases (30%), credits/kits (30%).
- **Cash Flow**: Positive from 2027 (+$0.05B); cumulative +$33T by 2050, +$1M+ by 2076.
- **NPV**: $11T (Earth-only; $50T space-inclusive at 7% discount).
- **IRR**: 35–45% (aggressive exponential scaling).
- **Break-even**: 2027 (Month 6–9 for pilots).

### Electronics and Appliances Segment
- **CAPEX**: $15B (2030) → $100B/year (2050).
- **Revenue**: $3B (2030) → $370B (2050); margins 60–80%.
- **Cash Flow**: Negative early (-$12.6B 2030) → positive by 2038 (+$4B); NPV $0.2T; IRR 14.66%.

### Power, Water, Carbon Balances (Annual Network-Wide, Selected Years)
| Year | Power Net (TWh) | Water Net (B gal) | Carbon Seq (M tons) |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 2027 | 0.01            | 0.2               | 1                   |
| 2035 | 7               | 140               | 700                 |
| 2050 | 37              | 740               | 3700                |
| 2076 | 500+            | 10K+              | 50K+                |

## Suggestions to Enhance Viability
- Prioritize quick wins like greens/biogas for self-funding.
- Use LLC isolation to test space tech on Earth (e.g., ECLSS in hubs).
- Cultural adaptations in global expansions for broader adoption.
