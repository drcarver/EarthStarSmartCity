# Genesis Network Project Overview

## Project Overview

The Genesis Network is a scalable, [regenerative](web/regenerative.md) and [standards compliant](web/standards.md) ecosystem designed to transform distressed lands into self-sustaining hubs for [food](web/food.md), [energy](web/energy.md), [water](web/water.md), [materials](web/materials.md), [humanitarian aid](web/humanitarian.md) and [community services](web/community.md). It achieves high resource closure (95–99%) through modular technologies, drawing selective inspiration from NASA BLSS/ECLSS principles for closed-loop systems optimized for terrestrial use. The  [Innovation Hub](web/innovation.md) serves as the core for business experimentation, housing independent LLCs that drive scaling and innovation.

This overview provides a list of all Innovation Hub modules (LLCs), prioritizing those inspired by NASA/ISS technologies. Modules are then separated into those essential for the regenerative architecture (core closed-loop sustainability) versus others (supplementary or revenue-focused).

The project can be stared with a minimal startup capital.  There is a phased [master plan](web/masterplan.md) that achieve positive cash flow in a the first year and then self funds all further expansion.

## [Innovation Hub Modules](web/innovation.md)

Modules are ordered with NASA/ISS-inspired ones at the top. NASA inspirations include closed-loop life support (ECLSS for waste/water/air management), bioregenerative systems (BLSS for food/aquaponics), modular habitats, and environmental monitoring/digital twins from space station tech.
