## Encapsulated Project Plan with Financials

### Project Overview
The Genesis Network deploys modular, regenerative hubs on distressed farmland, brownfields, and landfills, achieving net-positive energy, 95–99% water closure, and carbon negativity. It bootstraps via tents, scales exponentially through affiliates (10K–50K by 2035), and internalizes U.S. economy by 2060s. Key enhancements: Microbial biosolutions, blockchain credits, agroforestry, DAC, waste heat recovery, infrastructure recycling (RCA + ceramics), mining minimization, and co-op/LLC structures.

### Phased Timeline
- **2027–2030**: Pilots (1–20 hubs); self-funding by 2029.
- **2031–2035**: Regional (20–100 hubs); waste transformation.
- **2036–2045**: Acceleration (100–500 hubs); rewilding 100M+ acres.
- **2046–2050**: Maturity prep (500–1,000 hubs); 80–95% internalization.

### Financial Summary (Network-Wide, $B)
- **CAPEX**: 20–30 cumulative (offset 15–25% by grants like USDA REAP, EPA Brownfields, CHIPS, IRA).
- **Revenue Ramp**: 0.1 (2027) → 72–500 (2050); sources: Food/tiles (40%), electronics/gases (30%), credits/contracts (30%).
- **Cash Flow**: Negative early (-0.1 to -1.65B 2027–2030); positive ramp to +285B (2050).
- **NPV (7%)**: 400–700.
- **IRR**: 28–38%.
- **Break-Even**: 2032.

### Power/Water/Carbon Balances (Per Hub)
- Power: +50–100 GWh/year surplus.
- Water: +200–300M gallons/year recharge.
- Carbon: -0.4–-1.2 Mt CO₂e/year net negative.

### Feasibility Analysis
Technical (8.5/10), Economic (8/10), Environmental (9.5/10), Political/Social (7.5/10), Regulatory (8/10). Overall: 8.3/10 (70–80% success).
