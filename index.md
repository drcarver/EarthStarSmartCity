# Genesis Network
**Comprehensive Site Map with Integrated Financial Summaries**  
*Status: January 15, 2026 – Limited Regenerative Architecture Baseline*

## Home / Overview
- **[Project Vision](web/vision.md)**: Executive summary of the regenerative ecosystem, mission for post-scarcity, carbon negativity, and rural empowerment.
- **[Key Features](web/features.md)**: Closed-loop hubs, modular ceramics, hydroponics/aquaponics, biogas, microbial biosolutions, smallholder partnerships.
- **[Quick Facts](web/facts.md)**: 700+ hubs by 2040s; rewilding 200–400M acres; gigaton sequestration.
- **[Financial Snapshot](web/financial.md)**: Self-funding by 2029; IRR 32–42%; NPV $80–140B (7% discount, 2026–2076).

## About the Project
- **[Core PrinciplesC](web/core.md)**: Limited Regenerative Architecture, phased reintroductions, data moat flywheel, farmer empowerment.
- **Technologies**: NASA/ISS-inspired (ECLSS, Veggie); smart tiles/kits; plasma vitrification.
- **Environmental Impact**: Rewilding, blue-green carbon kits, water recharge; carbon balance (-0.9–1.7 MtCO₂e/hub/year).
- **Social Impact**: TerraWell FreeCare (free healthcare/food); 10,000–50,000 smallholder partners by 2040s.

## Roadmap & Timeline
- **50-Year Plan (2026–2076)**: Bootstrap (2026–2030), Regional Scale (2031–2040), Acceleration (2041–2050), Maturity (2051–2076).
- **Phased Milestones**: Self-funding 2028–2029; 140 hubs by 2032; nationwide coverage by 2060s.
- **Financial Projections**: Cumulative CAPEX $45–130B; revenues $500–2,000B+ by 2070s; break-even 2029.

## Components & Technologies
- **Tiles & Kits**: List of all modular tiles (structural, insulating, smart variants) and kits (e.g., Microbial Inoculant, Agroforestry Expansion, Security & Airlock).
  - Manufacturing: LCM at tile factory; inputs 70–95% waste; costs $1.80–7.50/m²; revenues $3–12/m².
- **Innovation Hub LLCs**: 9 LLCs (e.g., Housing & Infrastructure, Biorefinery, Food & Agro).
- **Sensor Handbook**: Types (electrochemical, radar), standards (IEEE 1451, ISO 14001), viability impacts.
- **Resilience Features**: Smart airlocks for security/pandemics; Faraday mesh for EMP; closed-loops for nuclear winter.

## Financials
- **Cost Breakdown (Cumulative 2027–2050, $B)**: Land/Remediation 2.5–7.5; Facilities 8–22; Biogas/Plasma 4–12; Kits 3–9; Infra 5–15; TerraWell 0.9–1.9; Loans 2–6; Total 25–73.
- **Cash-Flow Table (Selected Years, $B)**:
  | Year | CAPEX | Revenues | OPEX | Net | Cumulative |
  |------|-------|----------|------|-----|------------|
  | 2027 | 0.35  | 0.25     | 0.13 | -0.23 | -0.23    |
  | 2028 | 1.1   | 0.9      | 0.45 | -0.65 | -0.88    |
  | 2029 | 2.5   | 2.5      | 1.0  | -1.0  | -1.88    |
  | 2032 | 8.5   | 14       | 3.5  | +2.0  | +2.5     |
  | 2040 | 32    | 120      | 30   | +58   | +280     |
  | 2050 | 45    | 220      | 55   | +120  | +1,100   |
- **Metrics**: NPV $80–140B; IRR 32–42%; grants offset 15–25% (USDA REAP, EPA Brownfields).
- **Electronics/Appliances (Conditional)**: CAPEX $5–15B (post-2031); revenues $10–40B/year mature.

## Resilience & Feasibility
- **Disaster Analysis**: Ratings (e.g., Earthquakes 9/10, Nuclear Winter 8/10); mitigations (modularity, decentralization).
- **Feasibility Assessment**: Technical 8.5/10; Economic 8.5/10; Environmental 9.5/10; Political 8/10; Overall 8.5/10 (70–80% success).
- **Risks & Wins**: Top risks (burnout, volatility); quick wins (tent cash flow, farmer pilots).

## Resources
- **Downloads**: Roadmaps, financial models, kit specs.
- **Contact**: Partnership inquiries, smallholder applications.
