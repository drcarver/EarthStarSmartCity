# Genesis Network Project Index

**Welcome to the Genesis Network documentation repository.**

This is the central hub for all project materials — a comprehensive, modular, self-replicating regenerative civilization initiative developed by **Earth-Star Industries**.

The **Genesis Network** transforms distressed lands into closed-loop hubs producing food, energy, water, materials, electronics, healthcare, and community services with **95–99% resource closure**, scaling from pod clusters to regenerative cities, sovereign partnerships, and eventual space expansion.
