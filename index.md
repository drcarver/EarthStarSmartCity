# Genesis-EarthStar Project Index  
**GitHub Pages Site Map & Detailed Navigation**  
*With Integrated Financial Summaries – January 18, 2026*

## Site Overview

This index serves as the central hub for the Genesis-EarthStar Regenerative System GitHub Pages repository. All pages are structured for Jekyll minimal theme compatibility, with raw Markdown files for easy copy-paste and deployment. The site documents the full project: overviews, phased plans, components (tiles/pods/kits), resilience, roadmaps, and financials.  

**Navigation Structure**: Pages are organized by category; links assume file structure (e.g., /overview.md). Financials integrated per section (recomputed: self-funded focus; IRR 30–45%; pilot $20–60M 2027; network $15–40B by 2050; revenues $1–5M Year 1 → $100–300B/year by 2070).

## 1. Project Fundamentals

- **[Overview & Safety Instructions](/overview-safety.md)**: Core guidelines, disallowed activities, key principles. Financials: N/A (foundational).  
- **[Project Detailed Overview](/detailed-overview.md)**: Modular regenerative system, deployment strategy, performance (95–99% closure). Financials: Bootstrap CAPEX $3–5.5M; Revenue $1–10M early phases.  
- **[Core Principles & Products](/principles-products.md)**: Phased bootstrapping, key outputs (tiles, greenhouses, kits). Financials: IRR 45–55%; self-funding by Year 3.

## 2. Components Catalog

- **[Tiles, Pods & Kits List](/components-catalog.md)**: Full inventory with manufacturing, inputs, costs ($1.5–4.5/ft² tiles; $40–250k pods/kits), revenues ($4.5–12.5/ft²; $60–1,200k/year). Includes new kits (airlock, compliance). Financials: Margins 60–80%; network revenue $50–150B/year by 2035.  
- **[Sensor Handbook](/sensor-handbook.md)**: Detailed types, standards, evolution. Financials: Mini-fab revenue $500–1,200k/pod/year.  

## 3. Phased Implementation & Roadmaps

- **[Phased Implementation Plan](/phased-plan.md)**: Bootstrap (2026–2027) to exponential (2030–2035); detailed timelines, CAPEX ($0.3–30B), revenues ($0.1–150B/year).  
- **[Pod-Centric Architecture](/pod-architecture.md)**: Full pod variants (livestock emphasis), staggered cycles. Financials: Pod revenue $80–1,200k/year; cluster $0.9–140M.  
- **[50-Year Roadmap](/50-year-roadmap.md)**: NASA/ISS tech integration (*ECLSS/BLSS), feedback loops to lunar/Mars. Financials: Cumulative NPV $400–1,200B; space exports $200–500B by 2070.

## 4. Resilience & Feasibility

- **[Resilience Analysis](/resilience-analysis.md)**: Ratings for disasters (earthquakes 9/10; nuclear winter 7.5/10); mitigations (pods, airlocks). Financials: Resilience branding +10–20% premiums.  
- **[Feasibility Analysis](/feasibility-analysis.md)**: Overall 7.8/10; rapid self-funding path. Financials: IRR 28–42%; NPV $250–750B by 2050.  
- **[Risks, Mitigations & Quick Wins](/risks-quickwins.md)**: Top 10 risks; strategies; wins (e.g., greens revenue $1–5M Year 1). Financials: Exponential via cities/towers (growth 30–50% slower without funds but viable).

## 5. Organizational & Humanitarian

- **[Innovation Hub LLCs](/innovation-hub.md)**: List of 19 LLCs (core/deferred); risk spreading. Financials: Distributed revenues ($120–1,200M/LLC/year mature).  
- **[TerraWell FreeCare System](/terrawell-spec.md)**: 501(c)(3) spec; services, assets (centers $1.8–5.6M/unit). Financials: Tax deductions $0.21–0.38/$1 FMV; humanitarian value $18–42B by 2050.

## Financial Summary (Integrated Across Site)

- **Bootstrap (2026–2030)**: CAPEX $0.02–5B; Revenue $0.001–20B/year; Net +$0.005–50B (greens/biogas drive).  
- **Scale (2031–2050)**: CAPEX $15–40B; Revenue $50–150B/year; Self-funding; NPV $250–750B.  
- **Long-Term (2051–2076)**: CAPEX $500–1,500B; Revenue $200–1,500B/year; Space tech adds $200–500B.  
- **Enhancements**: Premiums +20–30%; credits $150–250/tCO₂e; margins 60–80%.
