# Earth-Star Sustainable Abundance

The Earth-Star Sustainable abundance system is a revolutionary modular hub-and-spoke urban ecosystem (MHUE) designed to house 20,000 residents in a 500-hectare footprint, scalable to accommodate the entire US population (333 million) by 2040. Inspired by Tesla’s Master Plan for sustainable energy, robotics, and AI, it integrates advanced ceramic tiles and smart studs with closed-loop systems for food, water, energy, and waste. The project features luxurious single-family homes, sustainable farms, a state-of-the-art hospital, a K-12 school, a shopping mall, low-income housing, hotels, churches, government offices, an industrial complex, a college campus, a smart airport, and a Colossus 2-sized data center, all interconnected by Tesla autonomous transport and hyperloops. It aligns with Green Star 5 Star, LEED Gold, WELL Silver, BREEAM Excellent, UN Sustainable Development Goals (3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13), # Earth-Star Industries – Project Index
