# Sensor Handbook for the Genesis Network

## Introduction

This handbook provides a comprehensive guide to the sensors used in the Genesis Network, emphasizing their types, applications, specifications, costs ($30–300/unit), redundancy (3–5x per point for fault tolerance), and AI integration (edge processing for real-time anomaly detection, predictive maintenance). Sensors form the foundation of the data moat, enabling ruthless optimization through short-cycle iterations and digital twins. All sensors are embedded in ceramic tiles/pods, manufactured in Mini-Fab LLCs, with costs recalculated for viability (bulk production reduces 20–30%; revenues from sales/upgrades +15–25%). Standards: IEEE 1451 (interfaces), MIL-STD-810 (ruggedness), OGC SWE (web enablement). Financials: Network-wide sensor CAPEX $5–10B by 2035 (offset by $10–20B revenues from data-driven efficiencies/credits); per hub $1–2M (revenues +$5–10M/year from optimizations).

## Sensor Types, Applications, Specs, and Costs

Sensors are hyper-dense, redundant, and AI-linked for cross-validation/drift detection. Costs include embedding/integration.

| Sensor Type | Description & AI Integration | Applications | Specs | Cost ($/unit) |
|-------------|------------------------------|--------------|-------|---------------|
| Electrochemical/Optical | Detect nutrients/pH/pathogens; AI flags deviations, predicts cycles. | Aquaponics, water management, biorefineries. | Accuracy ±0.1 pH; 0–50 ppm nutrients; response <1s. | 50–100 |
| Nanobiosensors/Microbial | Monitor soil activity/plant stress; AI correlates with yields for inoculant tweaks. | Agroforestry, soils, restoration kits. | Sensitivity 1–10 ppb; bio-compatible; wireless. | 80–150 |
| mmWave/IR-UWB Radar | Passive vitals/fall detection, weapons/explosives scan; AI alerts security/health. | Housing, airlocks, smart roads. | Range 10–20m; ±1 bpm/respiration; 3D imaging. | 100–200 |
| Multispectral/VOC | Pest/disease warning; AI predicts outbreaks via patterns. | Greenhouses, pods, urban planning. | Bands 400–2500nm; VOC sensitivity 1 ppm; imaging res 1cm. | 150–300 |
| Strain/Vibration/Piezo | Structural/traffic monitoring, energy harvest; AI detects wear/anomalies. | Tiles, roads, foundations. | Sensitivity 0.1g–10g; freq 0–5kHz; harvest 1–10 mW. | 40–80 |
| Thermal/Humidity/PAR | Climate/light control; AI optimizes LED/solar via forecasts. | All buildings, greenhouses. | ±0.5°C; ±2% RH; PAR 400–700nm ±5%. | 30–60 |
| Flow/Pressure/Acoustic | Utility monitoring, leak detection; AI routes bidirectional flows. | Pipes, digesters, DAC. | 0–100 psi ±1%; flow 0–10 m/s; acoustic 20–20kHz. | 50–100 |

## Redundancy and AI Integration

- **Redundancy**: 3–5x per measurement point; AI cross-validates (e.g., if one drifts, others flag/isolate). Reduces failure risk <1%; enables predictive swaps via twins.
- **AI Integration**: Edge AI (RISC-V processors) for real-time (noise reduction, anomaly flagging); cloud/network AI trains models on PB-scale data (e.g., weekly BSFL cycles for 10–50x experiments). Flywheel: More data → better predictions → higher yields (20–60%) → more sensors.
- **Financial Impact**: CAPEX $30–300/unit (bulk discounts); revenues +$5–10M/hub/year from efficiencies (e.g., 10–30% yield boosts); network $10–20B by 2035 from data moat optimizations/credits.

## Viability Enhancements

- Reuse: Embed in existing tiles/pods/kits (e.g., airlock kit for scans).
- New: Security AI Module Kit ($50–100K, revenues $150–300K from sales).
- Bottleneck Reduction: Parallel production in Mini-Fab LLCs; standards (ISO 14001) for compliance.
