# Detailed mmWave/Multispectral Sensor System for Genesis Network Airlocks

## Overview

The mmWave/multispectral sensor system is a core component of Genesis Network smart airlocks, embedded in ceramic tiles for all buildings/pods. It enables real-time scanning for weapons/explosives (mmWave for concealed detection), pathogens/biosecurity (multispectral for VOC/spectral signatures), and environmental anomalies (e.g., radiation, chemicals). System draws from NASA/ISS tech (*ECLSS sensors for air quality) and standards (IEEE 1451, MIL-STD-810). Manufactured in Mini-Fab Pods; inputs waste-derived (RHA silicon); materials silicon/ceramic hybrids. Costs: $100–200/unit; revenues: $300–600/unit (premium security kits). Financials: CAPEX $50–100M for production scale-up; revenues +$200–500M/year by 2035 (sales + compliance credits).

## System Design

- **mmWave Component**: 60–100 GHz radar for non-invasive body scans; detects metals/plastics (weapons/explosives) through clothing (range 1–5m, resolution 1cm). AI processes for false-positive reduction (e.g., keys vs. guns).
- **Multispectral Component**: 400–2500nm bands for VOC/pathogen detection (e.g., explosives residues, viral signatures); thermal IR for fever screening. Integrated with hyperspectral for biosecurity (e.g., COVID-like outbreaks).
- **Integration**: Embedded in airlock tiles (Faraday mesh for EMP); dual airlocks (entry/exit) with automated doors/seals. Alerts: AI-flagged to security (drones/human); lockdown protocols.
- **Power/Data**: Self-powered via piezo (foot traffic); edge AI (RISC-V) for privacy (local processing); wireless to hub network.
- **Accommodations**: Cultural/religious (e.g., opt-out modes, gender-separated scans); standards compliance (ISO/TC 268 privacy, HIPAA-equivalent).

## Manufacturing and Inputs

- **Process**: Mini-Fab Pods (65–130nm lithography for sensors); tile embedding during firing. Throughput: 100K–500K units/year/hub.
- **Input Sources**: 70–95% waste-derived (e.g., RHA silica from rice husks, recycled e-waste for silicon).
- **Materials**: Silicon dies + ceramic substrates; toughened for durability (60–100 MPa).
- **Viability Enhancements**: Reuse kits for modularity; data moat optimizes detection algorithms (20–60% accuracy gains via iterations).

## Financial Projections

Recalculated for viability: Low CAPEX via recycling; high margins (60–80%) from premiums/credits. Break-even Year 1 post-scale (2029).

| Year | CAPEX ($M) | Revenue ($M) | OPEX ($M) | Net Cash Flow ($M) |
|------|------------|--------------|-----------|--------------------|
| 2027 | 20         | 0            | 5         | -25                |
| 2028 | 30         | 50           | 10        | 10                 |
| 2029 | 50         | 200          | 20        | 130                |
| 2030 | 100        | 500          | 40        | 360                |
| 2035 | 100        | 1000         | 80        | 820                |

NPV: $5B (7% discount); IRR: 40–50%. Quick wins: Security kit sales to affiliates (+25% revenue).
