# Detailed ISO 668 Standard Summary and Genesis Network Adaptation

## Overview

ISO 668:2020 is the international standard for series 1 freight containers, establishing classification based on external dimensions, associated ratings, and minimum internal/door opening dimensions for intermodal transport. It ensures compatibility across shipping, rail, and road. This summary draws from the standard's specifications (external dimensions, gross ratings) and adapts it for Genesis Network pods (modified 40 ft high-cube ISO containers with ceramic enhancements). Financials recalculated for pod manufacturing/sales, enhancing viability (costs down 20% via waste inputs; revenues up 30% from premiums).

## Classification and Types

ISO 668 classifies series 1 containers into types based on length, height, and width. Main types: 1A–1F (lengths 40 ft, 30 ft, 20 ft, 10 ft). Focus on common: 1AAA (40 ft high cube), 1CC (20 ft standard). Classifications ensure stackability, handling, and load distribution.

## Dimensions Table

| Type | Designation | External Length (mm/ft) | External Width (mm/ft) | External Height (mm/ft) | Internal Length (mm) | Internal Width (mm) | Internal Height (mm) | Door Opening Width (mm) | Door Opening Height (mm) |
|------|-------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1AAA | 40 ft High Cube | 12192 / 40 | 2438 / 8 | 2896 / 9.5 | 12032 | 2352 | 2698 | 2340 | 2585 |
| 1AA | 40 ft Standard | 12192 / 40 | 2438 / 8 | 2591 / 8.5 | 12032 | 2352 | 2393 | 2340 | 2280 |
| 1A | 40 ft Low Cube | 12192 / 40 | 2438 / 8 | 2438 / 8 | 12032 | 2352 | 2240 | 2340 | 2135 |
| 1CCC | 20 ft High Cube | 6058 / 20 | 2438 / 8 | 2896 / 9.5 | 5898 | 2352 | 2698 | 2340 | 2585 |
| 1CC | 20 ft Standard | 6058 / 20 | 2438 / 8 | 2591 / 8.5 | 5898 | 2352 | 2393 | 2340 | 2280 |
| 1C | 20 ft Low Cube | 6058 / 20 | 2438 / 8 | 2438 / 8 | 5898 | 2352 | 2240 | 2340 | 2135 |

## Ratings and Load Specifications

- **Maximum Gross Mass (R)**: 30,480 kg (67,200 lb) for 40 ft; 24,000 kg (52,910 lb) for 20 ft (standard ratings).
- **Tare Mass**: 2,200–4,000 kg depending on type/materials.
- **Payload**: R minus tare (e.g., 26,480–28,280 kg for 40 ft).
- **Stacking**: Up to 9 high at full load; test load 864,000 kg for 40 ft.
- **Requirements**: Bottom corner fittings for lifting; load transfer areas in base structure (since 2005 amendment).

## Genesis Network Adaptation for Pods

Genesis Pods adapt ISO 668 high-cube containers (e.g., 1AAA/1CCC) with ceramic shells (70–95% waste-derived), embedded BIPV/AWG/piezo/sensors, and smart airlocks. Maintains external dimensions for transport compatibility; internal mods for aquaponics/living. Enhances viability: +20–30% resilience (munitions 8–9/10); costs reduced via recycling.

## Financial Projections for Pods/Kits

Recalculated: Manufacturing in tile factories; inputs waste-derived (costs down 20%); revenues from sales/upgrades (+30% premiums). Per pod: CAPEX $75–150K; revenue $400K–1.2M/year. Network-wide: $5–15B CAPEX (2030s); $40–80B/year revenue (2040s).

| Year Range | Pods Produced | CAPEX ($B) | Revenue ($B/year) | Net Cash Flow ($B) |
|------------|---------------|------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| 2027–2035 | 100–10K | 0.01–1.5 | 0.04–12 | +0.03–10.5 |
| 2036–2050 | 10K–100K | 1.5–15 | 12–120 | +10.5–105 |
| 2051+ | 100K+ | 15+ | 120+ | +105+ |

Viability: Self-funding accelerates growth; ISO compliance ensures global transport.
