# Genesis Network  
**Detailed pH / ORP / Conductivity Sensor Handbook**  
**Deployment • Calibration • Maintenance • Economics**  
**Earth-Star Industries Conceptual Baseline**  
*January 18, 2026*

## 1. Overview & Critical Role

pH, Oxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP), and Conductivity sensors form the **backbone** of water quality monitoring in all closed-loop systems:
- Aquaponics tanks (fish health, nutrient uptake)
- Biogas digestate recovery
- ECLSS-inspired water recycling
- Drinking water production
- Wastewater polishing

**Why triple-redundancy?**  
Any single sensor failure can cascade into fish kills, nutrient lockout, or regulatory violations.  
Genesis deploys **4–5× redundancy** per critical measurement point with cross-validation via edge AI.

## 2. Sensor Specifications Table

| Parameter       | Sensor Type                     | Measurement Range          | Accuracy (±) | Resolution | Response Time | Lifespan (typical) | Primary Standard       | Deployment Density |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------|------------|---------------|--------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| pH              | Combination glass electrode     | 0–14 pH                    | ±0.01–0.02   | 0.001      | <5 s          | 12–24 months       | ISO 7027, EPA 150.1    | 4–5× per tank      |
| ORP (Redox)     | Platinum combination electrode  | –2000 to +2000 mV          | ±1–5 mV      | 0.1 mV     | <10 s         | 12–18 months       | ASTM D1498             | 3–5× per system    |
| Conductivity    | 4-electrode graphite/platinum   | 0–200,000 µS/cm            | ±0.5–1%      | 0.01 µS    | <3 s          | 18–36 months       | ISO 7888, EPA 120.1    | 4–5× per loop      |

**Temperature compensation**: All sensors include integrated NTC thermistor (accuracy ±0.1°C)  
**Pressure rating**: 0–10 bar (submersible variants)  
**Material**: PVDF / PEEK body + titanium/platinum electrodes (corrosion resistance)

## 3. Deployment & Redundancy Architecture

- **Per tank/system**: Minimum 4 sensors (pH/ORP/Conductivity + spare)
- **Critical zones** (fish breeding, drinking water): 5× redundancy
- **Cross-validation**: Edge AI compares readings → flags drift/outlier (>2σ deviation)
- **Calibration stations**: Automated robotic calibration pods (buffers 4.01/7.00/10.01; ORP standard 220–468 mV)
- **Cleaning cycle**: Ultrasonic + acid/base flush every 7–14 days (AI-triggered based on drift)

**Alert thresholds** (configurable per species/system):

- pH: <6.5 or >8.0 → immediate adjustment (CO₂ dosing or base addition)
- ORP: <150 mV (anaerobic risk) or >450 mV (oxidizer overdose)
- Conductivity: >5,000 µS/cm (salt stress) or <200 µS/cm (nutrient deficiency)

## 4. Calibration & Maintenance Protocol

**Frequency**:
- Automated self-check: Daily (temperature + slope verification)
- Full 3-point calibration: Every 7–14 days (robotic)
- Electrode replacement: Every 12–24 months (predictive based on slope degradation)

**Calibration solutions**:
- NIST-traceable buffers (4.01, 7.00, 10.01)
- ORP standards: Zobell’s solution or quinhydrone
- Conductivity: 1413 µS/cm KCl standard

**Cost per sensor** (mature production, 2030+):

| Item                          | Unit Cost ($) | Replacement Cycle | Annual Cost per Sensor ($) |
|-------------------------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| pH electrode + transmitter    | 180–280       | 18 months         | 120–190                    |
| ORP electrode + transmitter   | 220–340       | 15 months         | 170–270                    |
| Conductivity electrode + tx   | 150–250       | 24 months         | 75–125                     |
| **Total per measurement point** | **550–870** | —                 | **365–585**                |

**Network-wide estimate** (mature 2,000-hub network, ~50K measurement points):  
- Annual sensor maintenance OPEX: **$18–29M**  
- Replacement CAPEX (every 1.5–2 years): **$27–43M**

## 5. Economic Summary – Sensor Network

- **Total sensor CAPEX** (bootstrap 2027–2030): $8–15M (initial deployment)  
- **Annual OPEX** (maintenance + calibration): $0.5–1.2M per hub (mature)  
- **Value created**: Prevents >$5–20M/hub/year in fish kills, nutrient loss, regulatory fines  
- **ROI**: <6 months payback (prevented losses vs. sensor cost)  
- **Revenue uplift**: 5–15% higher aquaponics yields from optimized water chemistry

## 6. Strategic One-Liner

**"pH, ORP, and Conductivity aren't just sensors — they are the nervous system that keeps the closed-loop alive. One bad reading can kill a tank. Five good ones keep the network breathing."**
