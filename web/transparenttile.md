*January 18, 2026*

## Executive Summary

The **Semi-Transparent BIPV Glazing Tile** is a core structural and energy-generating component of Genesis greenhouses, residential towers, community buildings, and agrivoltaic canopies.  
It combines **10–30% optical transmittance** (maximizing natural light for plants/residents) with **embedded thin-film photovoltaic cells** (5–15 W/m² output) and **dense sensor array** for real-time environmental monitoring and predictive maintenance.

**Key Performance (mature production)**  
- Transmittance: 10–30% (tunable per application)  
- Power density: 80–150 Wp/m² (bifacial gain +15–25%)  
- Sensor density: 4–8 sensors/m² (PAR, temperature, humidity, strain, soiling)  
- Lifespan: 30–50 years (ceramic substrate)  
- Annual revenue per 10,000 m² installed: $0.85–2.2M (power + sensor data + premium sales)

## Manufacturing Process & Inputs

**Primary Factory Inputs** (mature phase)  
1. Rice husk ash (silica source) – 40–60%  
2. Road C&D slag/fines – 20–35%  
3. Farm residues (bagasse/straw) – pore formers  
4. Thin-film PV precursor layers (licensed)  
5. Sensor dies (in-house TerraFab 65–130 nm)

**Process Flow**  
1. Mix & melt → glass-ceramic base  
2. Deposit semi-transparent PV thin-film  
3. Embed sensor array + conduits  
4. Press/form → fire (1,200–1,350°C)  
5. Plasma toughening + quality scan  
6. Snap-connector assembly

**Energy Use**: Biogas + waste heat recovery → net-positive factory
