# Genesis Network  
**Semi-Transparent BIPV Glazing Tile – Detailed Specification**  
**With Embedded Sensors • Manufacturing • Economics**  
**Earth-Star Industries Conceptual Baseline**  
*January 18, 2026*

## Overview

The **Semi-Transparent BIPV Glazing** is a core structural and energy-generating component of the Genesis Network.  
It serves as roofing and wall glazing for greenhouses, residential modules, community buildings, and education centers.  
Key features:
- 10–30% light transmittance (optimizes plant growth while generating power)
- Fully waste-derived glass-ceramic matrix (RHA silica + slag)
- Embedded silicon-based thin-film PV cells + integrated sensors
- Snap-together modular design with conduits for power/data/water
- Munitions-grade durability (8–9/10 rating) with Faraday mesh EMP protection

**Primary applications**:
- Greenhouse roofs → natural light + power + CO₂ enrichment
- Residential vaulted ceilings → daylighting + BIPV generation
- Community & TerraWell buildings → aesthetic + energy autonomy
