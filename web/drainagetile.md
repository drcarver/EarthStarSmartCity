# Genesis Network  
**Permeable Drainage Tile with Embedded Smart Sensors**  
**Detailed Specification & Financials**  
**Earth-Star Industries Conceptual Baseline**  
*January 18, 2026*

## Overview

The **Permeable Drainage Tile** is a specialized, smart infrastructure component designed for roads, sidewalks, parking areas, green spaces, and stormwater management zones within Genesis hubs and regenerative cities.  

**Core functions**:
- High-rate stormwater infiltration (up to 300–500 inches/hour)  
- Flood prevention & aquifer recharge  
- Embedded sensor array for real-time monitoring  
- Integration with smart ceramic pipe network (bidirectional flow)  
- 70–95% waste-derived composition (mature phase)

**Primary input sources** (mature production):
1. Road C&D debris (slag, concrete fines, asphalt millings) – 60–80%  
2. Rice husk ash (RHA) – silica & porosity enhancer  
3. Farm residues (bagasse, straw) – natural pore formers  
4. ELFM landfill slag – toughening agent  
5. Early virgin feldspar/kaolin (bootstrap only)

## Manufacturing Process

1. **Raw Material Preparation**  
   - Crushing & screening of C&D/ELFM slag  
   - Grinding RHA & agricultural residues  

2. **Mixing**  
   - 70–85% recycled aggregates + 10–20% RHA silica + 5–10% pore-forming agents  
   - Low-water binder (geopolymer or slag-based)  

3. **Forming**  
   - High-pressure extrusion or hydraulic pressing → open porosity structure  

4. **Drying & Firing**  
   - Tunnel dryer → high-temperature kiln (1,200–1,350°C)  
   - Controlled cooling for thermal shock resistance  

5. **Sensor Embedding**  
   - During pressing: pre-formed channels for sensor pods  
   - Post-firing: robotic insertion of sealed sensor modules  

6. **Quality Control**  
   - Permeability test (ASTM C1701)  
   - Compressive strength (ASTM C39)  
   - Sensor calibration & network test  

**Energy source**: Biogas microturbines + waste heat recovery  
**Automation level**: 90–95% lights-out (robotic handling & vision inspection)  
**Output capacity** (mature factory): 80,000–250,000 m²/month
