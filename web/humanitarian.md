# TerraWell FreeCare System: Humanitarian Aid Overview

## Mission & Core Philosophy

The **[TerraWell FreeCare System](TerraWell.md)**  operates as a standalone 501(c)(3) nonprofit under the independent TerraWell Foundation. Its sole purpose is to deliver **100% free humanitarian aid** — with no means testing, ID requirements, co-pays, or eligibility barriers — to the ill, needy, infants, and underserved populations across the United States.

All services and goods are provided **at no cost to recipients**. The system exists to alleviate suffering, improve public health, and restore dignity through accessible medical care, durable medical equipment (DME), medications, and nutritious food.

## Key Principles of Humanitarian Aid Delivery

- **Zero Barrier Access** — Walk-in, no-questions-asked service model  
- **Complete Privacy** — Strict HIPAA compliance; no data sharing with any for-profit entity  
- **Independence** — Strict legal firewall from any corporate operations  
- **Transparency** — Annual independent audits, public IRS Form 990 filings  
- **Focus on Dignity** — Facilities designed with respect, comfort, and cultural sensitivity  
- **Community Empowerment** — Free health literacy and self-care training modules via VR/AR
