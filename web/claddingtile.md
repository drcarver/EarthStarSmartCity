# Genesis Network  
**Smart Cladding – Sensors + Conduits**  
**Detailed Specification, Sensor Table, Manufacturing & Financials**  
**Earth-Star Industries Conceptual Baseline**  
*January 18, 2026*

## Overview

**Smart Cladding** is a multi-functional, toughened ceramic exterior/interior tile system embedding sensors, conduits, and protective features. It serves as the primary skin for nearly all Genesis structures (housing, schools, TerraWell centers, production pods, greenhouses, roads, and community buildings).

**Core Objectives**  
- Structural durability (60–120+ MPa compressive strength)  
- Embedded intelligence (sensors + data/power conduits)  
- Resilience (Faraday mesh, munitions-grade 8–9/10)  
- Sustainability (70–95% waste-derived inputs)  
- Compliance (ISO 37120, IEEE 1451, ISO 14001, NIST cybersecurity)

**Manufacturing Process**  
- Base: Same as structural tiles (slag/RHA + farm residues)  
- Embedding: During pressing/extrusion → insert Faraday mesh, sensor nodes, conduit channels  
- Firing: 1,200–1,400°C with plasma toughening  
- Final: Robotic quality inspection + functional testing (sensor calibration)  
- Factory output: 50,000–150,000 m²/month (mature single line)
