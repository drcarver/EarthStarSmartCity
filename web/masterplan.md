# Genesis Network Phased Milestones  
**Detailed Description with Financial Projections**  
*Status: January 15, 2026 – Limited Regenerative Architecture Baseline*

## Executive Summary

The Genesis Network's phased milestones outline a disciplined, risk-minimized path to scaling regenerative hubs from distressed land bootstrap to nationwide post-scarcity coverage. Under the Limited Architecture, phases prioritize core modules (tiles, greens, biogas, etc.) for rapid self-funding by 2029, with higher-complexity reintroductions gated by cash-flow triggers. Milestones span 2026–2050+, focusing on execution simplicity, data moat compounding, and farmer empowerment. Financials recomputed for 2026 realities: Cumulative CAPEX $25–73B (2027–2050); revenues ramp to $220B/year by 2050; self-funding 2028–2029; NPV $80–140B (7% discount). Viability enhancements (e.g., microbial yields, credits) add 15–25% revenue uplift without delays.

## Phase 1: Preparation & Bootstrap (2026–2028)

**Key Activities & Milestones**:  
- 2026: Legal formation, USDA loans for distressed land (500–2,000 acres pilots); tent erection for tile/greenhouse production; initial road/C&D contracts; farmer pilot MOUs (100–200 partners).  
- 2027: 4–8 hubs operational; greens/tiles/biogas revenue flowing; microbial inoculant pilots (+10% yields); brownfield remediation starts (5–10 sites).  
- 2028: 10–14 hubs; self-funding achieved; data moat baseline (dense sensors on pilots); TerraWell launch (2–4 centers).  

**Financial Projections (Network-Wide, $B)**:  
- CAPEX: 0.4–1.3 (tents, land, kits).  
- Revenues: 0.25–0.9 (greens/tiles/tipping).  
- OPEX: 0.13–0.58.  
- Net Cash: -0.23 to +0.7 (cumulative).  
- Quick Win: Greens margins (60–70%) fund expansion.

## Phase 2: Regional Scale & Self-Funding Maturity (2029–2032)

**Key Activities & Milestones**:  
- 2029: 15–30 hubs; agroforestry expansions; blockchain credits pilot ($150–250/tCO₂e); first trigger check (Industrial Gases if ≥6 months positive cash).  
- 2030: 40–80 hubs; dense urban ag in towers (+30% productivity); sewage replacement/remediation ramps; 500–1,000 farmer partners.  
- 2031: 100–120 hubs; waste heat recovery integrated (-5–15% OPEX); blue-green restoration kits deployed.  
- 2032: 140 hubs; Mini-Fab trigger check; full compliance portal operational.  

**Financial Projections (Network-Wide, $B)**:  
- CAPEX: 2.5–8.5 (phased infra/kits).  
- Revenues: 2.5–14 (plus credits +$0.2–0.5/hub).  
- OPEX: 1–3.5.  
- Net Cash: +2.5 to +22 (cumulative).  
- Viability Boost: Inoculants/credits add 15% uplift.

## Phase 3: Controlled Expansion & Triggered Additions (2033–2037)

**Key Activities & Milestones**:  
- 2033: 150–250 hubs; Industrial Gases online (if triggered); dam/river restorations; 2,000–5,000 partners.  
- 2034: 300–400 hubs; DAC pilots (if triggered); smart airlocks/security full rollout.  
- 2035: 450–500 hubs; consumer electronics check; global smallholder pilots (Africa/Asia).  
- 2036–2037: 550–600 hubs; cultured meat R&D (if triggered); rewilding 50–100M acres.  

**Financial Projections (Network-Wide, $B)**:  
- CAPEX: 10–28 (expansions + triggered modules).  
- Revenues: 18–95 (plus gases/electronics if triggered).  
- OPEX: 4.5–24.  
- Net Cash: +25 to +140 (cumulative).  
- Bottleneck Reduction: LLC parallelism isolates risks.

## Phase 4: Acceleration & Nationwide Coverage (2038–2045)

**Key Activities & Milestones**:  
- 2038–2040: 700+ hubs; 10,000 partners; cities incorporate (dense towers fuel growth); gigaton sequestration ramp.  
- 2041–2043: 60–80% U.S. internalization; port/maritime extensions (cladding/kits).  
- 2044–2045: Rewilding 200M acres; full standards compliance; global scaling (5,000–20,000 international smallholders).  

**Financial Projections (Network-Wide, $B)**:  
- CAPEX: 25–73 (mature expansions).  
- Revenues: 100–500.  
- OPEX: 25–125.  
- Net Cash: +280 to +620 (cumulative).  
- Growth Driver: Cities/towers enable exponential without funds (density +30–50%).

## Phase 5: Maturity & Legacy (2046–2050+)

**Key Activities & Milestones**:  
- 2046–2048: Nationwide coverage (370M people); planetary restoration; Mars feedback loops begin.  
- 2049–2050: Full post-scarcity; rewilding 400M acres; global partners 50,000+.  

**Financial Projections (Network-Wide, $B)**:  
- CAPEX: Maintenance (5–15).  
- Revenues: 180–220/year.  
- OPEX: 45–55/year.  
- Net Cash: +95 to +120/year (cumulative +700–1,100).  
- Long-Term: NPV $80–140B; IRR 32–42%.
