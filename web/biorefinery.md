# Biorefinery LLC – Detailed Specification

## Overview

The **Biorefinery LLC** is a cornerstone module of the Genesis Network Innovation Hub. It functions as a highly integrated, modular, closed-loop processing facility that transforms organic waste streams (agricultural residues, food processing byproducts, animal manure, sewage sludge, and organic MSW fractions) into multiple high-value products while achieving near-100% mass and energy closure for organics.

The facility operates on three primary conversion pathways — **biochemical** (anaerobic digestion), **thermochemical** (pyrolysis/gasification), and **biological** (microbial fermentation) — orchestrated by AI-driven process control, dense sensor arrays, and digital twins for continuous optimization.

## Core Functions & Process Flow

1. **Feedstock Reception & Preparation**  
   - Accepts internal hub wastes + external affiliate/municipal streams (tipping fees apply for non-affiliates)  
   - Mechanical pre-processing: shredding, grinding, slurrying, dewatering, contaminant removal

2. **Anaerobic Digestion (Primary Biochemical Stage)**  
   - Mesophilic/thermophilic digesters with continuous stirred-tank or plug-flow design  
   - Produces **biogas** (60–70% CH₄) and **digestate**  
   - Biogas upgrading to biomethane (>97% CH₄) via pressure swing adsorption or membrane separation

3. **Digestate Processing**  
   - Solid–liquid separation → centrifuge/dewatering  
   - Liquid fraction → nutrient recovery (struvite precipitation for phosphorus, ammonium stripping/recovery) → hydroponics/aquaponics feed  
   - Solid fraction → thermochemical processing

4. **Thermochemical Conversion**  
   - Slow/fast pyrolysis (400–600°C) or gasification (700–900°C)  
   - Yields:  
     • **Biochar** (30–50% mass yield, high fixed carbon)  
     • Bio-oil (condensable liquids)  
     • Syngas (used for power or synthesis)

5. **Microbial Inoculant Production**  
   - Dedicated fermenters cultivate tailored consortia (mycorrhizae, N-fixers, PGPR, phosphate solubilizers)  
   - Biochar as primary carrier matrix → protects microbes, enhances soil delivery  
   - AI-optimized formulations based on hub-specific soil/plant sensor data

6. **Energy & Heat Integration**  
   - Biogas/biomethane → on-site CHP turbines + heat recovery  
   - Waste heat → greenhouse heating, algae drying, district heating  
   - Surplus power → hub microgrid or export

## NASA/ISS Inspiration

The Biorefinery LLC directly adapts principles from NASA's **Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS)** and **Bioregenerative Life Support Systems (BLSS)**:  
- ECLSS: Waste-to-resource recovery (urine/water processing → oxygen/nutrients) → anaerobic digestion and nutrient looping  
- BLSS: Microbial bioreactors for waste mineralization and biomass conversion in closed ecological systems  
- Terrestrial scaling maintains emphasis on loop closure, multi-product output, and minimal external inputs

## Operational & Technical Characteristics

- **Modularity**: Initial tent bootstrap → permanent ceramic structures  
- **Automation**: Lights-out capable; edge AI + dense sensors (pH, redox, gas composition, temperature, microbial activity)  
- **Digital Twin**: Real-time process simulation, predictive maintenance, anomaly detection  
- **Compliance & Traceability**: Blockchain/PUF logging; ISO 14001, Cradle-to-Cradle alignment  
- **Scalability**: Flat-pack kits enable rapid replication across hubs and affiliates
