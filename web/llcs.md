# Innovation Hub LLCs: Detailed List

## Overview

The Innovation Hub consists of 19 independent LLCs (and one nonprofit foundation), each focusing on a core aspect of the Genesis Network's regenerative ecosystem. This structure isolates risks—failure in one LLC impacts <10% of operations, allowing parallel execution and distributed oversight to reduce burnout. Financials are recalculated aggressively: Per LLC average CAPEX $100–300M (network-wide $2–6B initial); revenues $100–500M/year/LLC mature (total $2–10B/year by 2035); margins 60–80% via closure. Quick wins: Kit sales/credits fund scaling; self-funding by 2029.

## List of 19 LLCs with Roles and Risk Mitigation
