# Detailed Technologies for the Genesis Network Project  
**Specifications, Sources, Integration, and Financials**  
*Status: January 15, 2026 – Limited Regenerative Architecture Baseline*

## Executive Summary

This document details the core technologies powering the Genesis Network, focusing on regenerative, closed-loop innovations derived from NASA/ISS inspirations, open-source adaptations, and in-house developments. Technologies are modular, waste-derived where possible, and optimized via the data moat for 95–99% closure. Financials recomputed for 2026–2050 (network-wide, $B cumulative): CAPEX $25–73 (phased, 15–25% grant offset); revenues $35–160 (greens/tiles drive early; credits +15% uplift); self-funding by 2029; IRR 32–42%; NPV $80–140 (7% discount). Enhancements (e.g., microbial yields) boost viability without added risks.
