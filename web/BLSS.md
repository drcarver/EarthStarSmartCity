# Genesis Network  
**Detailed BLSS (Bioregenerative Life Support System) Specification**  
**NASA/ISS Heritage • Multi-Trophic Closed-Loop Architecture • Earth-to-Space Transfer Path**  
**Earth-Star Industries Conceptual Baseline**  
*January 17, 2026*

## Executive Summary

The Genesis Network's **Bioregenerative Life Support System (BLSS)** is a fully closed-loop, [multi-trophic ecosystem](multi-trophic.md) that achieves **95–99% resource closure** for water, nutrients, oxygen, and food — directly descended from NASA/ISS ECLSS and BLSS research (Veggie, MELiSSA collaboration, advanced water recovery).  

Designed first for terrestrial hubs (rapid iteration, low-cost scaling), the system is intentionally ruggedized and modularized for eventual lunar/Mars deployment.  

**Core Architecture**  
- 5 trophic levels: Fish → Crustaceans/Mollusks → Insects → Plants → Microbial community  
- 95–99% water/nutrient recirculation  
- CO₂/O₂ balance via biogas enrichment & plant uptake  
- Short-cycle feedback (weekly–monthly) → ruthless optimization  
- Pod-centric (40 ft high-cube) + ceramic modular scalability  

**Primary Goal**  
Create a self-sustaining life support platform that can operate indefinitely on Earth (food/energy independence), then be exported to lunar bases (Artemis era) and Mars settlements (post-2050).

## BLSS Trophic Levels & Components

| Trophic Level       | Primary Organisms                              | Function / Outputs                                      | NASA/ISS Heritage                              | Earth Optimization Loop                              | Closure Contribution |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| 1. Primary Producers| Microalgae (Spirulina, Chlorella), Duckweed    | O₂ production, CO₂ fixation, protein biomass            | NASA Advanced Plant Habitat, MELiSSA algae     | Weekly harvest + 50–500 parallel variants → +40–80% yield | 30–50% O₂, 20–40% food |
| 2. Primary Consumers| Fish (Tilapia, Catfish, Trout, Barramundi pilots) | Protein production, waste generation                    | NASA early aquaponics experiments              | Monthly cohorts + multi-trophic integration → 95%+ nutrient use | 40–60% protein       |
| 3. Secondary Consumers | Crustaceans (Prawns, Crayfish), Mollusks (Mussels, Clams) | Detritus cleanup, filtration, additional protein        | NASA waste processing + filtration research    | Hides + density optimization → reduced cannibalism   | 10–20% protein + filtration |
| 4. Decomposers      | Insects (BSFL, Mealworms), Bacteria/Fungi      | Waste conversion to protein + biochar precursor         | NASA pyrolysis & microbial research            | Weekly BSFL harvest → 20–55% waste reduction         | 15–30% waste closure |
| 5. Nutrient Sink & Polishing | Higher Plants (greens, herbs, staples), Microbial inoculants | Nitrate/phosphate uptake, final water polishing         | NASA Veggie + MELiSSA plants                   | 8–12 crop cycles/year + inoculants → +10–30% yield   | 95–99% nutrient/water closure |

## Key Performance Metrics (Mature Terrestrial Hub)

- **Water Closure**: 95–99% (ECLSS baseline + AWG + microbial polishing)  
- **Nutrient Closure**: 92–98% (multi-trophic + biochar loop)  
- **Oxygen Balance**: Net-positive (plants + microalgae excess)  
- **Food Output**: 2,500–8,000 kg greens + 400–1,200 kg fish + 150–500 kg BSFL + 80–250 kg prawns per pod/year  
- **Energy Input**: 5–20 kW/pod (BIPV + biogas dominant)  
- **CO₂ Management**: Biogas exhaust enrichment → plant growth boost + O₂ surplus  

## NASA/ISS Lineage & Earth ↔ Space Feedback Loops

1. **Water Recovery**  
   NASA → Urine Processor + Brine Processor  
   Earth → 95–99% closure + AWG integration  
   Space → Lunar/Mars potable water from habitat waste

2. **Plant Growth**  
   NASA → Veggie + Advanced Plant Habitat  
   Earth → Vertical multi-trophic + short-cycle iteration  
   Space → Mars surface greenhouses (low-light optimized)

3. **Waste Processing**  
   NASA → Pyrolysis + MELiSSA microbial loops  
   Earth → Biochar + plasma vitrification → ceramic feedstock  
   Space → ISRU construction materials (lunar regolith bricks)

4. **Multi-Trophic Integration**

| Network-wide (1,000 hubs)  | —                          | —             | 1,200–4,500                         | 68–82%       | —              |

**Total BLSS contribution to network revenue** (mature phase): **~35–45%** of total ($600B–2,000B/year by 2060s)

**"NASA showed us how to survive in space for days.  
Genesis hubs show how to thrive there forever — then bring the blueprint back to the Moon and Mars."**
