# Direct Air Capture & Mineralization LLC  
**Genesis Network Innovation Hub Component**

## Overview

The **Direct Air Capture & Mineralization LLC** (DACM LLC) is a specialized entity within the Genesis Network responsible for capturing atmospheric CO₂ at scale and permanently sequestering it through mineralization processes. This module directly supports the Network's carbon-negative mission and contributes to gigaton-scale sequestration targets by 2050.

Positioned as one of the **NASA/ISS-inspired** components, DACM draws conceptual inspiration from **ECLSS CO₂ scrubbing technologies** used on the International Space Station, where carbon dioxide is continuously removed from cabin air and either vented (early systems) or converted into useful resources (advanced concepts). Here, the terrestrial adaptation focuses on large-scale atmospheric capture followed by permanent mineral storage rather than short-cycle recycling.

## Core Technologies & Processes

### 1. Direct Air Capture (DAC)
- **Modular Capture Units**  
  - Solid-sorbent based systems (amine-functionalized materials or metal-organic frameworks) deployed in fan-driven air contactors  
  - Low-temperature regeneration (80–120°C) using waste heat from biorefineries, plasma vitrification, and kilns  
  - Energy demand: 1.5–2.5 GJ/tCO₂ captured (mature phase target)  
  - Capture capacity per unit: 1,000–5,000 tCO₂/year (scalable modular design)

- **Liquid Solvent Alternative** (parallel pilot track)  
  - Potassium hydroxide or calcium hydroxide looping systems  
  - Higher temperature regeneration (higher energy but proven at scale)

### 2. CO₂ Mineralization (Permanent Sequestration)
- **Ex-situ Mineralization**  
  - Accelerated carbonation of alkaline industrial wastes (plasma vitrified slag, recycled concrete fines, steel slag, mine tailings)  
  - Reactors operate at 40–90°C and elevated pressure (5–30 bar)  
  - Produces stable calcium/magnesium carbonates (e.g., calcite, magnesite)  
  - Reaction: Ca(OH)₂ + CO₂ → CaCO₃ + H₂O (or similar for Mg)

- **In-situ Enhanced Weathering**  
  - Finely ground basalt or olivine spread across agricultural fields, agroforestry zones, and rewilding areas  
  - Natural reaction with atmospheric CO₂ forms carbonates over decades  
  - Synergistic benefits: improved soil pH, nutrient release (silica, magnesium), microbial stimulation

- **Integration with Network**  
  - Waste heat from kilns, plasma torches, and biorefineries powers regeneration  
  - Mineralized carbonates used as aggregates in sustainable concrete (RCA + carbonate fines)  
  - Excess CO₂ used for beverage carbonation, algae cultivation, or greenhouse enrichment

## Key Outputs & Benefits

- **Captured & Sequestered CO₂** — Primary product: verifiable, permanent removal  
- **Mineral Carbonates** — High-value aggregates for internal construction (tiles, roads, concrete)  
- **Carbon Removal Credits** — Blockchain-verified, high-integrity credits sold on voluntary markets  
- **Soil Enhancement** — Enhanced weathering improves fertility and water retention  
- **Circular Synergies** — Uses Network waste streams (slag, fines) as feedstock

## Operational Characteristics

- **Modular & Scalable** — Flat-pack kits for rapid deployment on brownfields and hub margins  
- **Automation & Monitoring** — Lights-out capable with edge AI, dense sensor arrays (CO₂ flux, temperature, pressure, mineral composition), digital twins for optimization  
- **Energy Source** — Primarily waste heat + surplus biogas/renewable electricity  
- **Water Usage** — Minimal (recycled process water); some units use dry carbonation  
- **Land Footprint** — Compact capture units (0.5–2 ha per 10 ktCO₂/year); enhanced weathering distributed across productive/re-wilding zones

## Financial Projections (Per Mature Hub, ~5,000 ha)

- **CAPEX**  
  - Initial pilot (1 ktCO₂/year): $8–15M  
  - Mature scale (50–100 ktCO₂/year): $150–300M (phased 2030s–2040s)

- **OPEX**  
  - $80–150/tCO₂ (energy, maintenance, monitoring)  
  - Target reduction to $50–80/tCO₂ by 2040 with waste heat optimization

- **Revenue Streams**  
  - Carbon removal credits: $150–250/tCO₂ (voluntary market premium for permanent mineralization)  
  - Mineral aggregate sales: $20–50/t (internal use offsets construction costs)  
  - Enhanced weathering co-benefits (yield increase, soil credits): $30–80/tCO₂ equivalent

- **Annual Financials (Mature Hub, 75 ktCO₂/year captured/sequestered)**  
  - Revenue: $12–22M (credits) + $2–4M (aggregates/co-benefits) = **$14–26M/year**  
  - OPEX: $6–11M  
  - Net Cash Flow: **+$8–15M/year**  
  - Payback Period: 8–12 years  
  - ROI: 12–18% (conservative credit pricing)

- **Network-Wide Potential (5,000 hubs by 2050)**  
  - Total sequestration: 375–500 MtCO₂/year  
  - Annual revenue: $60–125B (at $160–250/tCO₂ average)

## NASA/ISS Inspiration Summary

The DACM LLC adapts **ECLSS CO₂ removal** concepts (molecular sieves, amine scrubbers, Sabatier reactors) into large-scale terrestrial direct air capture with permanent storage, shifting from cabin air recycling to planetary atmosphere remediation. The emphasis on closed-loop energy use, modular design, and resource co-production echoes ISS life support engineering principles.

The Direct Air Capture & Mineralization LLC represents one of the most ambitious yet achievable pathways to gigaton-scale carbon removal within the Genesis Network, leveraging existing waste heat, alkaline materials, and modular deployment to deliver both climate impact and strong financial returns.
