# Genesis Network  
**Road Construction & Demolition (C&D) Debris as Primary Feedstock**  
**Focus: Slag • Concrete Fines • Asphalt Millings**  
**Earth-Star Industries Conceptual Baseline**  
*January 18, 2026*

## Executive Summary

**Road C&D debris** is the **single most important strategic feedstock** for the Genesis Network's ceramic tile & pipe production. It provides:
- Massive volume (U.S. generates ~150–200 million tons/year of C&D waste; roads/highways ~30–50% of total)
- High-quality mineral content (silica, alumina, calcium oxides ideal for toughened ceramics)
- Low/negative cost (tipping fees + low-bid contracts)
- Regulatory ease (C&D permitting far simpler than ELFM or MSW)
- Immediate availability (ongoing highway/road projects nationwide)

By prioritizing **road construction & demolition waste** (slag, concrete fines, asphalt millings), Genesis secures a near-unlimited, high-grade input stream that drives early self-funding, scales ceramic production, and creates a virtuous loop: win road contracts → process waste → produce tiles → bid more contracts.

## Feedstock Composition & Suitability

| Material                  | Primary Source                          | Typical Composition                              | Genesis Use                              | Advantages for Ceramics                  |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Slag**                  | Steel/iron production (road base)       | CaO 35–45%, SiO₂ 30–40%, Al₂O₃ 10–20%           | Primary flux & toughening agent          | High compressive strength, vitrification |
| **Concrete Fines**        | Crushed concrete from demolition        | CaO 60–70%, SiO₂ 20–30%, aggregates              | Main structural body + RCA substitute    | Excellent binding, low shrinkage         |
| **Asphalt Millings**      | Road resurfacing (milled surface layer) | Bitumen 4–8%, aggregates (SiO₂ dominant)         | Pore former + partial binder             | Improves porosity & fracture toughness   |

**Strategic priority ranking**  
1. Slag (best chemistry, highest value)  
2. Concrete fines (volume king)  
3. Asphalt millings (supplemental, easy access)

## Sourcing & Acquisition Strategy

- **Primary channels**:
  - State DOT & municipal road contracts (low-bid waste acceptance)
  - Private demolition contractors (tipping fees $5–25/ton)
  - Construction site direct pickup (zero-cost preferred)
- **Target volume** (mature hub): 500,000–2M tons/year
- **Economic model**:
  - Tipping fees: $10–30/ton revenue (early phase)
  - Low-bid contracts: $0–5/ton cost (feedstock + transport)
  - Net effective cost: **negative to $2/ton** at scale

## Processing Flow & Integration

1. **Intake** → Mobile crushers + screens (jaw/cone + magnetic separation)  
2. **Sorting** → Slag → fines → millings (optical + density separation)  
3. **Plasma Vitrification** (optional for contaminated streams) → clean slag feedstock  
4. **Mixing** → 70–95% C&D + RHA/farm residues  
5. **Forming & Firing** → Extrusion/press → 1,200–1,400°C tunnel kiln  
6. **Output** → Structural, insulating, BIPV, smart cladding tiles

**Energy use**: 80–90% biogas/waste heat recovery → minimal external power

## Financials – Per Mature Ceramic Factory (Annual, $M)

| Item                                   | Low Estimate | High Estimate | Notes / Assumptions                               |
|----------------------------------------|--------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Feedstock acquisition cost             | –15          | +5            | Tipping fees revenue → low-bid zero-cost          |
| Processing (crushing, plasma, mixing)  | 8–12         | 15–25         | Mobile units + energy efficiency                  |
| Firing & labor (lights-out)            | 10–18        | 20–35         | Biogas dominant                                   |
| **Total OPEX**                         | 18–30        | 35–65         |                                                   |
| Tile production volume (m²)            | 1.8M         | 6M            | 150K–500K m²/month                                |
| Average selling price ($/m²)           | 25           | 45            | Weighted across types                             |
| **Gross Revenue**                      | 45           | 270           |                                                   |
| **Gross Profit**                       | 15–27        | 205–235       | 60–78% margins                                    |
| **Net Contribution (after all costs)** | 10–20        | 180–210       | Primary self-funding engine                       |

**Network-wide (50–200 factories by 2040s)**: **$0.5–42B/year** from tiles alone

## Strategic & Viability Benefits

- **Fastest path to self-funding**: C&D is easiest to permit → revenue in Year 1–2  
- **Regulatory moat**: Builds credibility for harder streams (ELFM, sewage)  
- **Circular flywheel**: Process waste → tiles → build more hubs → win more road contracts  
- **Carbon & sequestration**: Avoids landfill methane + biochar integration → high-value credits

**Strategic One-Liner**  
**"Roads give us the waste.  
The waste gives us the tiles.  
The tiles give us the future."**
