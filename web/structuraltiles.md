## 1. Overview & Purpose

**Structural Load-Bearing Tiles** form the foundational building blocks of all Genesis Network infrastructure — from foundations and load-bearing walls to floors, multi-story towers, smart roads, and vaulted community structures.  
These tiles are engineered for **high compressive strength** (60–120+ MPa), **munitions-grade toughness** (8–9/10 rating), and **extreme durability** while incorporating **embedded smart sensors** for real-time structural health monitoring, predictive maintenance, and smart city compliance.

**Key Design Goals**  
- Replace conventional concrete/steel in most applications  
- 70–95% waste-derived at maturity  
- Snap-together modular system (LEGO-like)  
- Integrated sensors → data moat + safety  
- Support sustainable building codes (LEED, ISO 37120, ASTM C216/C1405)

## 2. Composition & Manufacturing Inputs (Mature Phase)

**Primary Inputs** (ranked by volume contribution)

| Rank | Input Material                        | Source / Origin                              | % of Final Composition | Notes / Processing                              |
|------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Road C&D debris (slag, fines)         | Construction & demolition waste              | 50–70%                 | Primary feedstock; plasma vitrified             |
| 2    | Rice husk ash (RHA)                   | Farm residue (silica source)                 | 15–25%                 | High-purity silica; pre-calcined                |
| 3    | Landfill ELFM slag                    | Enhanced landfill mining                     | 10–20%                 | Toughening agent; post-plasma                   |
| 4    | Farm residues (bagasse, straw, pomace)| On-site agricultural waste                   | 5–15%                  | Pore formers & natural tougheners               |
| 5    | Recycled glass fines                  | Internal processing & municipal waste        | 0–10%                  | Optional for glazing variants                   |

**Manufacturing Process**  
1. Crushing & sorting (mobile crushers)  
2. Mixing with binders & additives  
3. Extrusion / hydraulic pressing (automated)  
4. Drying (waste heat tunnel)  
5. High-temperature firing (1,200–1,400°C shuttle/tunnel kilns)  
6. Plasma vitrification toughening  
7. Sensor embedding (during pressing/firing)  
8. Robotic quality inspection & stacking  
→ Lights-out capable; biogas + recovered heat dominant

## 3. Embedded Sensor Suite (Standard in Load-Bearing Tiles)

All structural tiles include **3–5× redundant** sensor arrays embedded during manufacturing.
