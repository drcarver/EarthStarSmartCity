# Genesis Network  
**Innovation Hub LLC Structure & Comprehensive Sensor Handbook**  
**Earth-Star Industries Conceptual Baseline**  
*January 17, 2026*

## 1. Innovation Hub LLC Structure Overview

The Genesis Innovation Hub operates as a **federated network of 19 independent LLCs** (plus the separate 501(c)(3) TerraWell Foundation). This structure provides:
- Risk isolation (failure of one LLC does not cascade)
- Distributed leadership & talent recruitment
- Regulatory & political firewalling
- Parallel experimentation & specialization
- Antitrust defense via decentralization

**Ownership model**: Each LLC is majority-owned by a multi-stakeholder cooperative (residents, workers, affiliate farmers, governance council), with minority strategic interest held by Earth-Star Industries (parent entity) to ensure alignment & technology transfer.
