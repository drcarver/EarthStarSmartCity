# Genesis Network – Energy Module Detailed Specification

## Overview

The **Energy Module** is a cornerstone of the Genesis Network, responsible for generating, managing, storing, and distributing energy in a net-positive, closed-loop manner. It ensures all hubs, affiliates, and downstream operations achieve energy independence while producing significant surplus for internal relief programs, affiliate support, and external export. The module operates under a dedicated LLC structure (often integrated with or closely coordinated by the **Industrial Gases LLC** and **Transportation Infrastructure LLC**) and leverages biogas turbines as the primary baseload source, supplemented by agrivoltaics, wind, and waste heat recovery.

The Energy Module is designed to:
- Achieve **net-positive energy** status from Year 2 onward
- Provide **subsidized or zero-cost power** to affiliates and humanitarian programs
- Generate revenue through strategic surplus export
- Support gigaton-scale carbon negativity through avoided fossil fuel use and biochar-enhanced sequestration

## Core Components & Generation Mix

1. **Biogas Turbines (Primary Baseload – 60–75%)**
   - High-efficiency microturbines or reciprocating engines fueled by upgraded biomethane from the Biorefinery LLC
   - Typical capacity per mature hub: 5–15 MW continuous
   - Fuel source: 100% internal (crop residues, manure, food waste, digestate)
   - Efficiency: 38–45% electrical + 40–50% thermal recovery
   - Co-products: Waste heat piped to greenhouses, aquaculture, and DAC units

2. **Agrivoltaics & Rooftop Solar (Intermediate – 15–25%)**
   - Semi-transparent BIPV ceramic tiles on greenhouse roofs and vertical structures
   - Single-axis trackers over transplanted orchards/silvopasture
   - Capacity per hub: 10–30 MWp
   - Dual-use: Shade for crops/animals + panel cooling from evapotranspiration

3. **Wind & Small Hydro (Supplementary – 5–10%)**
   - Small-scale turbines (50 kW–2 MW) on elevated hub sites
   - Micro-hydro where topography allows (post-dam removal streams)
   - Primarily for affiliate farms in wind-prone regions

4. **Waste Heat Recovery & Thermal Storage**
   - Ceramic heat exchangers capture kiln, plasma, and turbine exhaust
   - Thermal mass (ceramic blocks) + phase-change materials store heat
   - Used for space heating, process heat, and greenhouse climate control

## Energy Balance (Per Mature Hub – ~5,000 ha)

| Source                  | Annual Generation (GWh) | Consumption (GWh) | Surplus (GWh) | Notes                              |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|---------------|------------------------------------|
| Biogas Turbines         | 40–90                   | 30–60            | 10–30        | Baseload, high capacity factor     |
| Agrivoltaics            | 15–40                   | 10–25            | 5–15         | Variable, seasonal                 |
| Wind & Hydro            | 5–15                    | 3–8              | 2–7          | Site-dependent                     |
| Waste Heat Recovery     | Equivalent 5–12 GWh     | —                | 5–12         | Thermal energy only                |
| **Total**               | **65–157 GWh**          | **43–93 GWh**    | **22–64 GWh**| **Net-positive 30–50%**            |

## Dedicated Relief & Export Sub-Program

The Energy Module includes a formal **Relief & Export Sub-Program** to strategically allocate surplus energy:

### 1. Relief Allocation (Priority Tier – Non-Revenue)
- **Affiliate Farms** — Subsidized power at **$0.00–$0.05/kWh** (often free during establishment phase)  
  - Supports 10,000–50,000 smallholders with starter packages  
  - Enables biogas digesters, pumps, lights-out robotics on partner farms
- **TerraWell FreeCare Centers** — 100% free electricity for medical clinics, mobile units, and training hubs  
  - Critical for off-grid resilience and humanitarian mission
- **Community Emergency Reserves** — 10–20% of surplus held in batteries/thermal storage for blackouts, disasters, or peak demand

### 2. Export Allocation (Revenue Tier)
- **Local Municipal/Industrial Sales** — Sold at market rates ($0.08–$0.15/kWh) to nearby towns, factories, or data centers  
- **Grid Interconnection** — Excess exported to regional grid under power purchase agreements (PPAs)  
- **Renewable Energy Credits (RECs)** — Tracked and sold separately (additional $5–$25/MWh)  
- **Blockchain-Verified Green Power** — Premium export to corporate buyers seeking verifiable carbon offsets

## Financial Projections (Per Mature Hub, Annual)

| Category                          | Amount ($M/year) | Notes                                      |
|-----------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Generation Cost**               | 4–8             | Mostly internal fuel + maintenance         |
| **Relief Allocation (Subsidized/Free)** | 2–5             | Affiliate farms + TerraWell (non-revenue)  |
| **Export Revenue**                | 15–45           | Grid sales + RECs + premium contracts      |
| **Net Energy Revenue**            | **+10–35**      | After internal consumption & relief        |
| **Carbon Credit Add-on**          | 5–15            | From avoided emissions + sequestration tie-in |
| **Total Energy Contribution**     | **+15–50**      | Significant hub profitability driver       |

**Network-Wide Projection (2050, 3,000–5,000 hubs)**  
- Total surplus generation: 60,000–300,000 GWh/year  
- Export revenue potential: $100–400B/year  
- Relief impact: Powers millions of affiliate farms and humanitarian facilities at near-zero cost

## Operational & Technical Highlights

- **DC-Dominant Microgrid** — Primary distribution at 380–800 V DC to minimize conversion losses  
- **Smart Energy Management** — AI-driven load balancing, predictive dispatch, and dynamic pricing for export  
- **Redundancy & Resilience** — Multiple generation sources + battery/thermal storage + affiliate interconnection  
- **Compliance & Traceability** — Embedded sensors + blockchain for RECs and carbon accounting  
- **Scalability** — Flat-pack turbine and solar kits enable rapid affiliate deployment

The Energy Module with its dedicated Relief & Export Sub-Program transforms the Genesis Network from energy-independent to energy-abundant, creating a powerful engine for rural empowerment, humanitarian support, and substantial revenue generation while maintaining strict alignment with regenerative and carbon-negative principles.
