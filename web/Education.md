## NASA/ISS Inspiration

The Education & Telepresence LLC draws direct conceptual inspiration from NASA/ISS training methodologies:  
- Extensive use of high-fidelity simulations and digital twins for astronaut training  
- Telepresence and remote robotics operations (Canadarm, external payloads)  
- Competency-based certification systems for mission-critical skills  
- Continuous training in closed-loop environmental management and systems integration

These principles are adapted for terrestrial regenerative operations, emphasizing scalability, accessibility, and integration with real-world sensor data.

## Key Infrastructure & Technology Stack

- **Hardware**: Self-produced edge computers, VR/AR headsets, haptic devices, large-format simulation displays  
- **Software**: Custom Genesis Dojo engine, AI tutors (based on RISC-V open-source stack), digital twin framework  
- **Connectivity**: High-bandwidth satellite/Starlink + fiber backbone for low-latency telepresence  
- **Facilities**: Dedicated telepresence hubs embedded in every major residential cluster and hub
