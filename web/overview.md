# Genesis Network Project Overview

## Project Overview

The Genesis Network is a scalable, regenerative ecosystem designed to transform distressed lands into self-sustaining hubs for food, energy, water, materials, and community services. It achieves high resource closure (95–99%) through modular technologies, drawing selective inspiration from NASA BLSS/ECLSS principles for closed-loop systems optimized for terrestrial use. The Innovation Hub serves as the core for business experimentation, housing independent LLCs that drive scaling and innovation.

This overview provides a list of all Innovation Hub modules (LLCs), prioritizing those inspired by NASA/ISS technologies. Modules are then separated into those essential for the regenerative architecture (core closed-loop sustainability) versus others (supplementary or revenue-focused).

## Innovation Hub Modules

Modules are ordered with NASA/ISS-inspired ones at the top. NASA inspirations include closed-loop life support (ECLSS for waste/water/air management), bioregenerative systems (BLSS for food/aquaponics), modular habitats, and environmental monitoring/digital twins from space station tech.
