*January 18, 2026*

## Overview

The **Insulating Thermal Mass Tile** is a specialized structural ceramic module optimized for **passive thermal regulation** in Genesis Network housing, community buildings, greenhouses, and livestock pods. It combines high compressive strength, excellent insulation, and massive thermal storage capacity with embedded smart sensors for real-time structural health, temperature, humidity, and environmental monitoring.

**Key Design Goals**  
- Maximize passive heating/cooling (reduce HVAC load 40–70%)  
- Provide structural integrity (60–100+ MPa compressive strength)  
- Enable dense sensor integration for data moat  
- Achieve 70–95% waste-derived composition at maturity  
- Support full lights-out manufacturing & snap-together assembly
