# Genesis Network - Supported Standards & Compliance Overview

The Genesis Network aligns with a broad portfolio of international, national, and industry standards across agriculture, environmental management, smart infrastructure, electronics, building systems, and sustainable development. This deliberate alignment ensures interoperability, regulatory acceptance, safety, environmental responsibility, and audit-readiness while positioning the Network as a reference implementation for future standards evolution.
