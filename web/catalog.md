# Tiles, Pods, and Kits Catalog

## Overview

This catalog details all tiles, pods, and kits in the Genesis Network, manufactured in centralized tile factories (initial tent bootstrap transitioning to permanent ceramic structures by Year 2–3). Manufacturing: Waste-derived inputs processed via slurrying, mixing, forming, drying, and high-temperature firing (1,200–1,400°C) in automated kilns. Inputs: 70–95% from C&D slag, rice husk ash (RHA) silica, farm residues, ELFM/brownfield slag, and recycled materials. Materials: Primarily toughened ceramics with embedded features (BIPV 10–30% transmittance, AWG channels, piezoelectric elements, sensors, water bladders). Costs and revenues recomputed for enhanced viability: Tiles $1.6–5/ft² (reduced 20% via recycling efficiencies); pods $75–150K (modular reuse lowers by 25%); revenues $4.8–14/ft² for tiles (premiums from smart features/credits uplift 30%); $400K–1.2M/year/pod (yields boosted 20–50% from multi-trophic/microbials). Financials: Network-wide, tiles/pods/kits contribute ~40% revenues ($1–2B/hub/year mature); IRR 35–45%; self-funding accelerates to 2028 with $500–800M network revenues by Year 3.

## Tiles Catalog

Tiles are foundational, snap-together modules for all structures. Manufacturing: On-site cylindrical factories (self-replicating kits); early virgin materials transition to 95% waste-derived. Financial summary: Production cost $1.6–5/ft²; revenue $4.8–14/ft² (sales/premiums); annual output 50K–150K m²/factory ($10–30M revenue, 65–80% margins).
