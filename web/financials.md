# Genesis Network Financial Summaries

## Overview

This page provides encapsulated financial summaries for the Genesis Network, recalculated incorporating all project enhancements (e.g., multi-trophic yields +50–60%, microbial boosts +10–30%, blockchain credits $150–250/tCO₂e, infrastructure recycling savings 15–30%, pod-centric CAPEX reductions 20–30%). Assumptions: Conservative ramp (1 hub 2027 → 3,700 by 2050); 60–80% margins from closure; short-term grants offset 15–25% early CAPEX (phased out by 2030). Timelines: Foundation 2027–2035; Acceleration 2036–2045; Maturity 2046+. NPV: $11.08T (7% discount, adjusted for realism); IRR: 30–40% (conservative; aggressive scaling potential 45–55%); Break-even: 2027 (pilot cash-positive).

## Recalculated Costs and Revenues

**CAPEX Breakdown (Per Hub, Average)**: $200M total (pods $50M, infrastructure $50M, fabs $50M, restoration $50M); network-wide ramps from $0.2B (2027) to $40B/year (2050).

**OPEX Breakdown (Per Hub/Year, Mature)**: $50M (maintenance $20M, labor $10M, utilities $20M—reduced via autonomy).

**Revenue Sources (Per Hub/Year, Mature)**: $1B (food/proteins 40%, tiles/gases/electronics 30%, credits/kits 30%).

## NPV, IRR, and Break-Even

- **NPV**: $11.08T (7% discount rate over 2050 horizon; recalculated with 20–30% cost reductions from recycling/microbials).
- **IRR**: 30–40% (conservative; aggressive scaling to 45–55% with space revenues post-2050).
- **Break-Even**: 2027 (initial pilot hub positive cash flow); full network self-funding by 2029 (cumulative +$6.1B).

## Summary of Key Financial Drivers

- **Cost Reductions**: Pod-centric (20–30% lower CAPEX); waste-derived inputs (70–95%); automation (80–95% lights-out reducing OPEX 50–80%).
- **Revenue Uplifts**: Multi-trophic yields (+50–60%); credits (+15–25%); electronics/gases (30% of total).
- **Timeline Adjustments**: Accelerated by 1–2 years via quick-cycle outputs (greens/BSFL); space integration adds $10–50B/year post-2050.
