## Overall Risk Profile & Financial Implications

- **Aggregate kill probability** (project never reaches 50+ hubs): **~55–70%**  
- **Probability of meaningful scale** (200–1,000+ hubs, $50B+ annual revenue): **~25–35%**  
- **Most likely outcome** (realistic middle case): 30–150 hubs, $2–15B/year revenue, strong regional player  
- **Best realistic case** (disciplined execution + luck): 500–2,000 hubs, $100–800B/year, transformative influence

**Cumulative financial impact of top risks** (if unmitigated):  
- **Worst-case wipe-out** (Risks 1–3): –$300M to –$1.5B  
- **Moderate stall** (Risks 4–7): –$150M to –$800M delay  
- **Quick wins combined** (all 10 executed): **+$200M to +$750M** cumulative by 2030

## Strategic One-Liner

Everything else is survivable if we breathe."**
