## 1. Manufacturing & Supply Chain Overview

All **[tiles](components/tiles/tiles-catalog.md)**, **[pods](components/pods/pods-catalog.md)**, and **[flat-pack kits](components/kits/kits-catalog.md)** are manufactured exclusively from **[Genesis Tile Factory](components/tiles/tile-factory.md)** (initial tent-based kilns → permanent ceramic factories).  
- **Inputs**: 70–95% waste-derived (C&D slag, rice husk ash silica, farm residues, ELFM slag, brownfield materials)  
- **Materials**: Toughened ceramic composite (60–100+ MPa compressive strength) + embedded features (BIPV, AWG, piezo, sensors, Faraday mesh)  
- **Manufacturing Path**: **[Tile Production Pods](components/pods/tile-production-pods.md)** → temporary kilns → permanent cluster retrofits (6–12 months)  
- **Cost Basis**: Production $1.6–$5.0/ft² (varies by type); selling price $4.8–$14.0/ft² (premium for smart features)  
- **Revenue Model**: Internal use (zero-cost to Network) + external sales (60–85% margins); affiliate kit sales; premium upgrades  

**All buildings** (hubs, housing, TerraWell centers, factories) are constructed **exclusively** from **[tiles](components/tiles/tiles-catalog.md)**, ceramics, and **[flat-pack kits](components/kits/kits-catalog.md)**.  
**[Smart Airlocks](docs/standards/smart-airlocks.md)** (dual-entry, mmWave + hyperspectral scanning for weapons/explosives/pathogens) are mandatory in all structures and alert on-site security.  
**[Smart City Standards](docs/standards/smart-city-standards.md)**: ISO/TC 268, IEEE 2030, ITU-T Y.4900, Matter/Thread/Zigbee, ISO 14001, Cradle-to-Cradle.  
**[Sustainable Building Codes](docs/standards/sustainable-building-codes.md)**: Full compliance (passive design, net-zero energy/water, waste-derived materials, LEED-equivalent via sensors).

## 5. Detailed Sensor Handbook

**[Sensor Handbook](docs/sensors/sensor-handbook.md)** provides comprehensive details on all sensors used in the Genesis Network.

| Sensor Type                  | Measured Parameter(s)                          | Location / Application                           | Redundancy | Power Source | Standards Alignment |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------|---------------------|

**Handbook Notes**  
- All data feeds local twins → federated learning network  
- Edge processing for privacy; blockchain-verified for credits/audits  
- Self-calibration via redundant arrays; predictive maintenance alerts  

## 7. Viability Enhancements & Bottleneck Reductions

- **Innovation Hub LLC Structure**: 19 independent LLCs isolate failure; distributed oversight reduces burnout.  
- **Farmer Empowerment**: Loans/kits/revenue-share create political shield and distributed scaling.  
- **Dense Sensor Net**: Ground radar + Starlink on properties for mapping/reclamation tracking; minimal regulatory issues (private land).  
- **Space Extension**: Sensor nets on Luna/Mars for planning; replication techniques enable off-world factories.  
- **Bottleneck Reductions**: Pre-supply from staging hubs; parallel testing; affiliate flywheel; modular upgrades.
