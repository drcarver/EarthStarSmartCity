## Overview

All Genesis Network structures, pods, roads, and infrastructure are built exclusively from **toughened ceramic tiles** produced on-site in **Tile Production Pods** or permanent retrofitted factories. Tiles are **70–95% waste-derived**, use **embedded active features** (BIPV, AWG, piezo, sensors), and comply with smart city standards (**ISO/TC 268**, **IEEE 2030**, **ITU-T Y.4900**) and sustainable building codes (**Cradle-to-Cradle**, **ISO 14001**).

**Manufacturing Process**:
- Raw material intake → mixing → forming/extrusion → drying → firing (1,200–1,400°C) → embedding (PV/piezo/sensors) → quality control → snap-together assembly.
- Lights-out automation: 80–95% by maturity.
- All tiles produced from **waste-derived feedstock**; minimal virgin materials only in bootstrap phase.

**Input Sources (70–95% waste-derived)**:
- C&D slag, ELFM slag, brownfield materials
- Rice husk ash (silica source)
- Farm residues (bagasse, straw, grape pomace as pore-formers/toughening agents)
- Plasma-vitrified residues

**General Cost & Revenue Notes**:
- Production cost: $1.3–$5.0/ft² (waste-derived savings + automation).
- Selling price: $4–$15/ft² (premium for active features).
- Margins: 65–85% mature.
- Network revenue: $10–$30B/year (2040s base case).

## Viability & Implementation Notes

- **100% on-site production** eliminates supply chain risk.
- **Waste-derived feedstock** reduces costs 40–60% vs. virgin materials.
- **Smart airlocks** mandatory in every structure for security and biosecurity.
- **Standards compliance** (ISO, IEEE, NASA-adapted) enables regulatory acceptance and premium pricing.
- **Revenue driver**: Premium active tiles + security features → $10–$30B/year network-wide (2040s).
