# Tiles Catalog  
**Genesis Network Component Specifications**  
**Last Updated: January 21, 2026**

All tiles are manufactured exclusively in **Tile Production Pods** located within each **regenerative hub**. Production utilizes **tunnel kilns**, **high-pressure extruders**, **automated presses**, and **plasma vitrification units** for slag toughening. Input materials are **70–95% waste-derived**, ensuring circular economy compliance and cost reduction.

## Core Manufacturing Process

1. **Raw Material Intake** → Front-end loaders/conveyors feed stockpiles  
2. **Mixing & Forming** → High-capacity pan mixers + extruders/presses  
3. **Drying** → Tunnel dryers with waste heat recovery  
4. **Firing** → 1,200–1,400°C tunnel/shuttle kilns (biogas or electric)  
5. **Finishing & Embedding** → Robotic handling embeds **BIPV layers**, **piezo elements**, **AWG channels**, **Faraday mesh**, and **sensors**  
6. **Quality Control** → Vision-guided inspection + strain/thermal testing  

All tiles meet or exceed:  
- ASTM C216 (facing brick), ASTM C1405 (glazed units)  
- EN 14411 (ceramic tiles)  
- ISO 14001 (environmental management)  
- Cradle-to-Cradle principles
