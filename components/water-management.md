# Water Management in the Genesis Network

**Water management** is a foundational pillar of the **Genesis Network**, achieving **95–99% resource closure** through a multi-layered, regenerative approach. All hubs operate near-complete water autonomy, with excess production used for aquifer recharge, export to affiliates, or support of **TerraWell FreeCare** humanitarian operations.

The system is designed to function in arid, temperate, and coastal environments, with modular adaptations for space (lunar/Mars) applications tested via **[analog testing pods](pods/analog-testing.md)**.

## Core Components of Water Management

1. **Digestate Recovery**  
   - **Process**: Anaerobic digestion of manure, food waste, and aquaponics sludge produces biogas and nutrient-rich digestate. Liquid fraction is separated via ceramic membrane filtration and treated for reuse.  
   - **Recovery Rate**: 15–25% of input water reclaimed as irrigation-grade; solids composted or fed to **[BSFL pods](../components/pods-catalog.md)**.  
   - **Integration**: Slurry piped directly from **[livestock pods](pods/livestock.md)** and **[aquaponics pods](pods/aquaponics-multi-trophic.md)** to **[biogas digester pods](pods/biogas-digester.md)**.  
   - **Benefits**: Eliminates external fertilizer need; reduces methane emissions 70–90livestock.md%; supports **[microbial inoculant production](../components/microbial-inoculant-production.md)**.

2. **Atmospheric Water Generation (AWG)**  
   - **Technology**: Embedded AWG channels in **[roof glazing](tiles/roof-glazing.md)** and **[exterior cladding](tiles/exterior-cladding.md)** tiles condense humidity from air. Indoor AWG in **[insulating tiles](tiles//insulating.md)** recaptures evapotranspiration and respiration.  
   - **Capacity**: 40–70% of total water from tile-integrated AWG; supplementary compact units for arid peaks.  
   - **Efficiency**: +20–30% yield from heat recovery (waste heat from kilns/fabs); AI-triggered operation based on humidity forecasts.  
   - **Space Adaptation**: Low-gravity condensate collection tested in **[analog testing pods](pods/analog-testing.md)** for lunar/Mars habitats.

3. **Rainwater & Stormwater Harvesting**  
   - **Design**: Sloped canopies and permeable **[road tiles](../components/tiles-catalog.md)** direct water to ceramic-lined cisterns; gutters pipe directly into structural supports.  
   - **Treatment**: Multi-stage filtration (biochar + ceramic membranes) + UV sterilization.  
   - **Storage**: Embedded water bladders in tiles for thermal mass and radiation shielding.

4. **Closed-Loop Recirculation**  
   - **Aquaponics/Greenhouse**: 90%+ recirculation with nutrient polishing by mollusks/crustaceans.  
   - **Livestock**: Greywater from washing routed to **[biogas digester pods](../components/pods-catalog.md)**.  
   - **Housing/Community**: Blackwater treated via plasma-enhanced systems; greywater reused for irrigation.

## Impacts on Timelines & Financials

- **Timeline Acceleration**: Digestate + AWG reduces external water dependency by 70–90% in Year 1; full closure achieved Month 6–12 vs. 18–24. Space trials shorten lunar/Mars adaptation by 1–2 years.  
- **Financial Uplift**:  
  - CAPEX Reduction: 10–20% ($50–100B total 2027–2077) from waste-derived systems.  
  - Revenue Boost: +$5–15B/year from water export/credits; IRR 58–85%; NPV $1.1T–$2.8T.
