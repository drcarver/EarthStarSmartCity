# Smart Pipe Kit  
**Bidirectional Slurry/Power/Data Pipes**

## Overview

The **Smart Pipe Kit** provides modular, bidirectional infrastructure for the Genesis Network, enabling efficient transport of slurry (waste/feedstock), DC power, data (fiber/sensor nets), and optional pneumatic/robotic delivery. Pipes are produced in the **Tile & Pipe Production Pod** and integrated into all hubs, roads, and buildings.

## Key Features

- **Bidirectional Flow**: Supports import/export of slurry, power, water, biogas, data  
- **Modular Design**: Snap-together ceramic segments (1–5 m lengths); hot-swappable  
- **Embedded Intelligence**: Sensors for flow, pressure, leak detection; RISC-V edge compute  
- **Power Distribution**: DC-dominant (802.3bt PoE++ compatible)  
- **Data Integration**: Fiber conduits + mmWave inductive short-range  
- **Materials**: 70–95% waste-derived toughened ceramics (C&D slag, RHA silica)  
- **Standards Compliance**: ISO/TC 268 (smart cities), IEEE 2030 (smart grid), ITU-T Y.4900, ASTM C76 analogs  

## Manufacturing & Inputs

- **Production**: **Tile & Pipe Production Pod** → permanent factories  
- **Inputs**: C&D slag (65–75%), rice husk ash silica, farm residues, ELFM slag  
- **Process**: Extrusion/molding → firing (1,200–1,400°C) → sensor embed → snap joints  
- **Cost**: $8–$18 per linear meter (production); $20–$45 per meter (selling/affiliate)  
- **Revenue**: $2–$8B/year network-wide (external sales + internal efficiency gains)
