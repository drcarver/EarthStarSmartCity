## Overview

All **flat-pack kits** are self-replicating, modular systems enabling rapid deployment of Genesis Network components. Kits are manufactured in **[tile production pods](components/pods/tile-production-pods.md)** using 70–95% waste-derived inputs, evolving from recycled steel to toughened ceramic composites. They support **[sustainable building codes](docs/standards/sustainable-building-codes.md)** (net-zero, passive design) and include **[smart airlocks](components/tiles/smart-airlock-tiles.md)** for security scanning (weapons/explosives). Reused kits minimize redundancy; new kits added for viability (e.g., sensor net deployment). Costs/revenues recomputed: Production $0.2–$5M/kit; selling $0.5–$12M/kit; margins 60–85%.

**Handbook Notes**  
- **Data Moat Flywheel**: Short-cycle iterations (microalgae/BSFL weekly) generate PB-scale data; parallel tanks (50–500 variants) → 10–50x experiments/year.  
- **Edge AI**: Real-time processing; federated learning for privacy.  
- **Viability Enhancements**: Self-calibration; sensor net for rural internet revenue (+$50–150M/hub/year); space deployment for mapping (Luna/Mars).  

## Suggestions to Enhance Viability & Reduce Bottlenecks

- **Bottleneck Reductions**: Pre-supply staging hubs for kits/tiles; parallel LLC operations in innovation hub; microbial kits for +10–35% yields.  
- **Viability Boosts**: Sensor net internet revenue; blockchain credits ($150–250/tCO₂e); agroforestry for early sequestration; sustainable concrete hybrids for 15–30% infra savings.
