## Objective

The **Smart Airlock Kit** provides modular, snap-in secure entry systems for all Genesis buildings, pods, and complexes, detecting weapons, explosives, narcotics, and anomalies while maintaining privacy and compliance. It integrates with the Network's dense sensor nets and digital twins for real-time alerts and data feed, ensuring biosecurity, threat mitigation, and alignment with smart city standards.

## Key Features & Integration

- **Detection Capabilities**: mmWave body scanner for concealed objects; hyperspectral camera for anomalies; IMS/Raman trace detectors for explosives/narcotics.
- **Operation**: Mantrap double-door interlock (2–4 s normal entry); lockdown on threat + silent alert to **[Basic Security & Monitoring Tile](components/tiles/basic-security-monitoring-tile.md)** and security team.
- **Disinfection**: Far-UVC cycle for pandemic resilience.
- **Integration**: Blind-mate to **[Exterior Cladding](components/tiles/exterior-cladding.md)** or **[Interior Insulating Partition](components/tiles/interior-insulating-partition.md)**; feeds **[Dense Sensor Net Kit](components/kits/dense-sensor-net-kit.md)** and **[digital twins](docs/digital-twins.md)** for incident mapping; supports **[RTK GNSS Anchor Tile](components/tiles/rtk-gnss-anchor-tile.md)** for location precision.
- **Standards Compliance**: **[ISO/TC 268](docs/standards/iso-tc-268-smart-cities.md)** (smart city security), IEEE 2030 (interoperability), ITU-T Y.4900 (IoT), Matter/Thread (networking); sustainable codes via waste-derived ceramics (**[ISO 14001](docs/standards/iso-14001-environmental.md)**, Cradle-to-Cradle).
- **All Buildings Requirement**: Mandatory in every structure (hubs, pods, housing, retail) for unified security.

## Manufacturing Process

- Location: **[Tile & Pipe Production Pods](components/pods/tile-pipe-production-pod.md)** → permanent tile factories.
- Inputs: 70–95% waste-derived (C&D slag, RHA silica, farm residues).
- Materials: Toughened ceramic shell + reinforced glass doors + embedded electronics/sensors.
- Process: Ceramic injection molding → sensor/camera lamination → blind-mate socket integration → final firing/QC.
- Kit Contents: Modular tiles, doors, detectors, installation tools; flat-pack for easy assembly.

## Recomputed Costs & Revenues (February 2026 Baseline)

- **Production Cost**: $80k–$200k per kit (down 5–10% via waste efficiencies).
- **Selling Price**: $300k–$700k per kit (includes installation/training; margins 60–75%).
- **Annual Revenue** (network-wide, mature): $1–$3B (internal use 50%, affiliate/external sales 50%; +10–15% uplift from standards compliance credits $50–$150M/year).
- **CAPEX Impact**: Minimal ($20–$50M network-wide for R&D/integration); payback 6–12 months via security contracts.
- **Revenue Model**: Internal mandatory (all buildings); external sales to municipal/commercial/critical infrastructure; premium subscriptions for AI alerts/upgrades.
- **IRR Contribution**: +5–8% to network (overall 35–50%).
