# Smart Airlock Kit  
**Genesis Network Secure Entry & Biosecurity Module**

## Overview

The **Smart Airlock Kit** is a modular, flat-pack security and environmental control system integrated into every **Genesis Network** building, pod cluster, housing unit, **TerraWell FreeCare** center, **TerraFab** cleanroom, and high-value zone. It provides:

- Physical separation between internal controlled environments and external conditions  
- Active scanning for weapons, explosives, contraband, and biological threats  
- Automated access control and security alerting  
- Compliance with smart city and sustainable building standards  

All components are manufactured in **tile factory pods** using waste-derived toughened ceramics, ensuring **95–99% closure** and full compatibility with the **pod-centric architecture**.

## Key Features

- **Dual-chamber design** — Entry vestibule + decontamination/buffer zone  
- **mmWave & multispectral scanning** — Non-invasive detection of metallic/non-metallic threats  
- **Explosives trace detection** — Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) or similar low-power sensor  
- **Pathogen & bio-threat screening** — VOC + aerosol sampling with AI anomaly detection  
- **Faraday shielding** — Embedded copper mesh protects internal electronics from EMP  
- **UV-C & HEPA filtration** — Sterilization and air purification during cycle  
- **Biometric + RFID access** — Optional; defaults to anonymized entry for **TerraWell** zones  
- **AI-driven decision engine** — Local RISC-V edge compute; alerts security or locks down  
- **Fail-safe mode** — Mechanical override + manual vent in power loss  

## Physical Specifications

| Component                  | Material                     | Dimensions (standard) | Weight (installed) | Cost per Unit (2026) |

| Air handling unit          | Ceramic ducts + HEPA/UV-C    | 0.8 m × 0.6 m × 0.4 m | 40–60 kg           | $2,500–$4,000        |
| Edge compute & sensors     | RISC-V board + redundancy    | Integrated            | 5–10 kg            | $1,200–$2,000        |
| **Total per kit**          | —                            | 3.0 m × 2.4 m × 2.4 m footprint | 450–650 kg         | **$25,000–$38,000**  |

## Manufacturing & Inputs

- **Produced in**: **Tile Factory Pods** using tunnel kilns, robotic assembly, and plasma vitrification  
- **Primary inputs**: C&D slag (60–75%), rice husk ash silica, farm residues, ELFM/brownfield slag  
- **Embedded electronics**: Sourced from **Mini-Fab** (sensors, RISC-V boards) or licensed mature-node parts  
- **Assembly**: Snap-together ceramic panels + pre-wired conduits; flat-pack shipping  

## Installation & Integration

- Mounts as modular extension to any **ceramic building** or **pod cluster**  
- Connects to **smart infrastructure pipes** for power, data, and compressed air  
- Interfaces with **AI security & smart city kit** for network-wide monitoring  
- Complies with:  
  - **ISO/TC 268** smart city indicators  
  - **ITU-T Y.4900** sustainable cities metrics  
  - **IEEE 2030** smart grid interoperability  
  - **MIL-STD-810** environmental ruggedness  
  - **NASA-STD-3001** closed-loop environmental control principles  

## Operational Modes

1. **Normal Entry** — Scan → green light → inner door opens (2–4 s cycle)  
2. **Threat Detected** — Red alert → lockdown → security notified via **smart infrastructure**  
3. **Bio-Threat Mode** — UV-C cycle + HEPA purge (30–60 s); optional quarantine hold  
4. **Emergency Override** — Manual mechanical release + vent to exterior  

## Cost & Revenue Model

- **Manufacturing cost per kit**: $25,000–$38,000 (mature production 2030+)  
- **Internal deployment cost**: $30,000–$45,000 (including labor/integration)  
- **External sales/upgrade revenue**: $60,000–$95,000 per unit (defense, commercial, allied nations)  
- **Annual recurring**: $2,000–$5,000/unit (maintenance, firmware updates, sensor calibration)  
- **Network-wide impact**: Required in ~5,000–15,000 buildings/hubs by 2040 → $150M–$700M annual upgrade revenue stream  

## Viability Enhancements

- Reduces biosecurity risk in pandemics → **+15–25%** project viability  
- Attracts defense contracts (NATO/Fortress West) → **+$50–150M/year** early revenue  
- Enables **TerraWell FreeCare** safe access in high-risk zones  
- Supports smart city compliance → qualifies for additional grants/credits
