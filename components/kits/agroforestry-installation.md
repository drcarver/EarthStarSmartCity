# Agroforestry Expansion Kit Installation Guide

This guide provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for deploying the **Agroforestry Expansion Kit** on Genesis Network hubs, smallholder mini-hubs, or affiliate farms. The kit is designed to integrate **alley cropping**, **perennial polycultures**, **silvopasture**, and **dwarf orchard systems** under or alongside existing productive zones, adding long-term sequestration, diversified revenue, and soil regeneration without requiring additional land footprint.

## Kit Contents

- **Trellis & Support Systems** (modular aluminum/ceramic composite poles, adjustable cross-members, tension cables)  
- **Dwarf Tree Pots & Fabric Containers** (pre-inoculated, root-pruned, 3–6 year old stock: almonds, avocados, citrus, figs, peaches, apples, pomegranates)  
- **Microbial Inoculant Applicators** (handheld sprayers + bulk totes of mycorrhizae, nitrogen-fixers, rhizobia)  
- **Drone Monitoring & Mapping Kit** (edge AI drone with multispectral camera, pre-loaded flight paths)  
- **Sensor Arrays** (soil moisture, PAR, temperature, strain on trellises)  
- **Biochar & Compost Amendments** (initial 1–2 tons per hectare equivalent)  
- **Installation Manual & QR-linked Digital Twin Baseline** (for AI optimization)  

## Pre-Installation Preparation

1. **Site Selection & Mapping**  
   Choose zones with partial shade from existing **agrivoltaics**, **mature orchard pods**, or **silvopasture grazing areas**. Use the **drone monitoring kit** to create a baseline multispectral map (PAR, NDVI, soil moisture). Target 200–400 ha per mature hub or 10–50 ha per smallholder mini-hub.

2. **Soil & Microbial Prep**  
   Apply **microbial inoculant** (mycorrhizae + nitrogen-fixers) at 5–10 L/ha via sprayer or drip. Incorporate biochar (10–20 t/ha) into top 15–30 cm to enhance water retention and carbon storage.

3. **Permitting & Community Alignment**  
   For smallholder sites, confirm land tenure and obtain farmer/co-op approval. In affiliate regions, integrate cultural/religious considerations (e.g., sacred tree species, halal/kosher grazing zones).

## Step-by-Step Installation

### Step 1: Layout & Grid Setup (Day 1–2)
- Mark rows using drone-mapped GPS coordinates (alley width 4–8 m, tree spacing 3–6 m).  
- Install **trellis poles** every 6–10 m along rows (driven 0.8–1.2 m deep).  
- Connect cross-members and tension cables to form stable support grid.

### Step 2: Tree Planting & Inoculation (Day 3–5)
- Place **dwarf tree pots** or fabric containers at marked points.  
- Remove pots, backfill with biochar-amended soil.  
- Apply second dose of **microbial inoculant** directly to root zone.  
- Stake young trees if wind exposure is high.

### Step 3: Sensor & Monitoring Deployment (Day 6)
- Install **soil moisture/PAR/temperature sensors** at 10–20% of tree locations (3–5× redundancy).  
- Connect to hub edge AI via smart ceramic conduits or wireless mesh.  
- Launch drone baseline flight to establish digital twin reference.

### Step 4: Integration & Grazing Linkage (Day 7–10)
- Link to **livestock pods** for rotational **silvopasture** (sheep/goats under trees).  
- Pipe manure slurry to **biogas digesters** or **microbial inoculant production**.  
- Seed understory with nitrogen-fixing legumes or perennial herbs.

### Step 5: Commissioning & Optimization (Day 11–14)
- Activate drone monitoring schedule (weekly multispectral flights).  
- Feed baseline data into **digital twin** for AI-optimized irrigation/fertilization.  
- Monitor first 30–90 days for establishment success (target >90% survival).

## Maintenance & Long-Term Management

- **Years 1–3**: Focus on establishment; prune for shape, monitor microbial activity.  
- **Years 4+**: Begin fruit/nut harvest; rotate grazing; refresh inoculants annually.  
- **AI Feedback**: Data moat refines layout for future expansions (yield +10–30%).  

## Safety & Compliance

- Use **smart airlocks** on any enclosed processing areas.  
- Comply with **ISO 14001** (environmental management) and local sustainable agriculture codes.  
- Document all installations via **digital twin baseline** for carbon credit verification.
