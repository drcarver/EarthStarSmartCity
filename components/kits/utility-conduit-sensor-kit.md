# Utility Conduit & Sensor Kit  
**Detailed Specification**  
**Genesis Network Component – January 2026 Baseline**

The **Utility Conduit & Sensor Kit** is a modular, flat-pack system for embedding bidirectional utilities (power, water, data, slurry) and hyper-dense sensors into **Genesis Network** structures. Manufactured exclusively at the **Tile Factory**, it supports all buildings constructed from tiles, ceramics, and kits. This kit enhances resilience, enables the data moat flywheel, and ensures compliance with smart city standards (ISO/TC 268, IEEE 2030) and sustainable building codes (net-zero, Cradle-to-Cradle).

## Manufacturing & Supply Chain

- **Production Location**: **Tile Production Pods** → permanent factories (tent bootstrap to ceramic retrofit in 6–12 months).  
- **Inputs**: 70–95% waste-derived (C&D slag, rice husk ash silica, farm residues, ELFM slag, brownfield materials).  
- **Materials**: Toughened ceramic composite (60–100+ MPa compressive strength) + conductive layers (copper/silver nanowires from recycled electronics) + sensor embeds.  
- **Process**: Ceramic extrusion + firing (1,200–1,400°C kilns) + post-embed (sensors, conduits via blind-mate sockets).  
- **Output Capacity**: 50,000–150,000 m linear conduit/year per mature factory.  

## Kit Components & Features

- [**Utility Conduits Specification**](../components/utility-conduits.md): Modular ceramic pipes (multi-channel: potable/grey/black water, DC power, fiber data, compressed air/slurry).  
- **Sensor Integration**: Hyper-dense embeds (3–5× redundancy) for real-time monitoring.  
- **Smart Airlocks**: Included modules for all buildings – dual-entry with mmWave/hyperspectral scanning for weapons/explosives/pathogens; auto-alert to security (edge AI processing).  
- **Smart City & Security Standards**: ITU-T Y.4900 KPIs, Matter/Thread/Zigbee interoperability; ISO 14001 environmental logging; MIL-STD-810 ruggedness.  
- **Sustainable Building Codes**: Net-zero compliance via AWG/recovery; waste-derived materials; passive thermal mass.  

**Cost & Revenue**  
- **Production Cost**: $2.0–4.5/ft (conduit + sensors).  
- **Selling Price**: $6.0–12.0/ft (premium for smart features).  
- **Annual Revenue Potential (Network-wide, mature)**: $2–8B (internal use + external/affiliate sales).

## Viability Enhancements Implemented

- **Bottleneck Reductions**: Pre-supply feedstock from staging hubs; parallel testing for sensor embeds.  
- **Suggestions Applied**: Reuse **Tile Production Pods** for kit manufacturing; integrate airlocks as standard in all kits.
