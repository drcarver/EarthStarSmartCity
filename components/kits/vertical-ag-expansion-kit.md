## Objective

The **Vertical Ag Expansion Kit** enables high-density urban farming by adding stacked hydroponics/aeroponics layers to existing structures, boosting yields 30–50% with minimal land use. It integrates with **[Residential & Community Zones](docs/regenerative-city-layout.md)** for rooftop/balcony farming, supporting **[Productive Core](docs/regenerative-city-layout.md)** goals in regenerative cities.

## Key Components & Features

- **Hydro Racks & LED Tuning**: Modular ceramic stacks with adjustable LED lighting for optimized growth.
- **Recirc Pumps & Nutrient Delivery**: Closed-loop systems tied to **[AWG & Condensate Recovery](components/energy-water-closure-systems.md)** for water sovereignty.
- **Integration**: Snap-in to **[Roof Glazing (Semi-Transparent BIPV)](components/tiles/roof-glazing-bipv.md)** and **[Canopy Microclimate Tile](components/tiles/canopy-microclimate-tile.md)**; supports **[Microbial Inoculant Production Kit](components/kits/microbial-inoculant-production-kit.md)** for yield boosts.
- **Standards Compliance**: Aligns with **[ISO/TC 268](docs/standards/iso-tc-268-smart-cities.md)** for smart ag and **[ISO 14001](docs/standards/iso-14001-environmental.md)** for sustainability; bird-safe designs.

## Manufacturing Process

- Location: **[Tile & Pipe Production Pods](components/pods/tile-pipe-production-pod.md)** → permanent factories.
- Inputs: 70–95% waste-derived (residues, bagasse for aerated components).
- Materials: Toughened ceramic frames + LED embeds.
- Process: Molding → embed pumps/LEDs → assembly → QC with **[Dense Sensor Net Kit](components/kits/dense-sensor-net-kit.md)**.

## Recomputed Costs & Revenues (February 2026 Baseline)

- **Prod Cost**: $15k–$35k/kit (down 5–10% via waste efficiencies).
- **Selling Price**: $25k–$60k (premium for urban density; margins 60–70%).
- **Revenue Model**: Affiliate sales (smallholders/urban farms); internal hub use; sequestration credits from enhanced yields (+$50–$150M/hub/year indirect).
- **Financial Impact**: +$100–$300M/network-year from kit sales; ROI <1 year per deployment; IRR uplift +3–5% (network 35–50%).
