# Biogas Digester Kit

## Overview

The **Biogas Digester Kit** is a modular, flat-pack system designed for rapid deployment in **Genesis Network** hubs, affiliate farms, and smallholder mini-hubs. It converts organic waste (manure, crop residues, food processing waste, sewage sludge) into **biogas** (primarily methane for energy) and **digestate** (nutrient-rich slurry for fertilizer or aquaponics feed). The kit achieves high biogas yield with minimal external inputs, supporting **95–99% resource closure** when integrated with other pods.

## Key Features

- **Capacity**: Scalable from 5 m³ (smallholder) to 100 m³+ (hub-scale cluster)  
- **Feedstock Flexibility**: Accepts livestock manure, aquaponics sludge, crop residues, kitchen waste, and pre-processed sewage  
- **Biogas Output**: 50–70% methane; usable for microturbines, cooking, heating, or CO₂ enrichment in **greenhouses**  
- **Digestate Recovery**: Liquid/solid separation; liquid routed to **aquaponics** or fields; solids to **microbial inoculant production** or **biochar**  
- **Automation**: Edge AI monitoring (pH, temperature, gas pressure); robotic slurry pumping and maintenance alerts  
- **Mobility**: Containerized flat-pack; can be relocated via autonomous movers  
- **Resilience**: Ceramic-lined tanks (corrosion-resistant); off-grid capable with biogas self-powering  

## Design & Components

- **Primary Tank**: Insulated, ceramic-lined anaerobic digester (continuous stirred-tank or plug-flow design)  
- **Gas Collection**: Floating drum or flexible membrane with pressure regulation  
- **Slurry Management**: Pre-mixing hopper, robotic feed pump, solid-liquid separator  
- **Safety**: Pressure relief valves, methane leak sensors, explosion-proof electronics  
- **Integration Ports**: Bidirectional smart pipes for feedstock input (from **livestock pods**) and digestate output (to **aquaponics** or fields)  

## Manufacturing

- Produced in **Ceramic Tile Production Pods** and **kit assembly lines**  
- Primary material: **toughened ceramics** (waste-derived: C&D slag, rice husk ash, ELFM slag)  
- Assembly: Snap-together ceramic modules + licensed microturbine/separator components  
- Quality control: Embedded sensors for real-time leak/pressure monitoring  

## Input Sources & Materials

| Component          | Primary Input Sources                  | Materials                     | % Waste-Derived |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| Tank Lining        | C&D slag, brownfield residues          | Toughened ceramic composite   | 80–95%          |
| Gas Holder         | Recycled membrane + ceramic frame      | Flexible polymer + ceramics   | 70–85%          |
| Pumps & Valves     | Licensed components + ceramic housing  | Ceramics + stainless internals | 60–80%          |
| Sensors            | **Mini-Fab** output (RISC-V edge)      | Ceramics + silicon embeds     | 70–90%          |

## Cost & Revenue (Per Unit, Mature Phase)

| Scale              | CAPEX ($K) | Annual OPEX ($K) | Biogas Output (m³/day) | Digestate (m³/day) | Annual Revenue ($K) | Payback Period |
|--------------------|------------|------------------|------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Smallholder (5 m³) | 60–100     | 5–10             | 10–20                  | 4–8                | 30–80               | 1.5–3 years    |
| Hub Cluster (50 m³)| 150–250    | 15–30            | 100–200                | 40–80              | 200–500             | 1–2 years      |
| Large Hub (100 m³+)| 300–500    | 30–60            | 200–400                | 80–160             | 500–1,200           | <1.5 years     |

**Revenue Streams**  
- Energy sales (biogas → electricity/heat)  
- Digestate fertilizer sales or internal use (yield boost in **aquaponics**/**agroforestry**)  
- Carbon credits ($150–250/tCO₂e equivalent via methane avoidance)  
- Tipping fees (external organic waste intake)  

## Integration & Standards

- Connects to **livestock pods** (manure input), **aquaponics pods** (digestate nutrient feed), and **processing pods** (waste trimmings)  
- Compliant with ISO 14001 (environmental management), IEEE 2030 (smart grid), and local biogas safety codes  
- Supports **smart city standards** via embedded sensors and bidirectional data flow  

## Viability Enhancements

- Pre-inoculation from staging hubs → stable methane in 1–2 weeks (vs. 21–90 days)  
- Microbial boosts (+10–30% yield) via **Microbial Inoculant Kit**  
- Waste heat recovery for tank heating → 10–20% efficiency gain  
- Blockchain-verified credits monetized early  

This kit is a foundational energy and nutrient recycler in the **Genesis Network**, enabling off-grid resilience and circular economy at scale.
