# Multi-Trophic Aquaponics Pods  
**Genesis Network Component Specification**

**Multi-Trophic Aquaponics** pods form the protein and nutrient-cycling core of every **regenerative hub**. Each pod is a self-contained, closed-loop ecosystem built inside a modified **40 ft high-cube ISO container**, achieving **95–99% water and nutrient closure** while producing continuous, staggered harvests of fish, crustaceans, mollusks, insects, and plants.

## Pod Base Specifications

- **Physical Envelope**: 40 ft high-cube ISO container (~67 m³ internal volume)  
- **Shell Evolution**: Recycled steel (early) → **95–100% waste-derived toughened ceramic** (mature, munitions-resistant 8–9/10 rating)  
- **Cladding & Glazing**: Snap-on **ceramic tiles** with **semi-transparent BIPV glazing** (10–30% transmittance) + embedded **AWG channels**  
- **Power**: 5–20 kW (BIPV roof + biogas microturbine + piezoelectric floor harvest)  
- **Energy Storage**: Sodium-ion batteries (10–50 kWh, 2–5 days autonomy)  
- **Water Management**: 100–400 L/day makeup (AWG + rainwater + digestate recovery); **95–99% recirculation**  
- **Airlocks**: Dual smart **airlocks** with mmWave/multispectral scanning for biosecurity  
- **Automation**: Lights-out robotics (feeding, harvesting, waste transfer); RISC-V edge AI  
- **Sensors**: Hyper-dense array (3–5× redundancy): pH, ammonia, DO, temperature, VOC, multispectral imaging  

## Multi-Trophic Layering (Closed-Loop Synergy)

The system is deliberately layered to mimic natural trophic cascades:

1. **Primary Fish Layer** (Protein & Nutrient Engine)  
   - Freshwater dominant (80–90% of pods): **Nile/Blue Tilapia hybrids**, **Channel Catfish**, **Rainbow Trout** (cold zones)  
   - Saltwater/brackish pilots (coastal 10–20%): **Barramundi**, **Red Drum**, **Atlantic Salmon** (niche cold coastal)  
   - Stocking: 500–5,000 fish per pod cluster; staggered cohorts for continuous harvest (every 6–12 months)  

2. **Crustacean Layer** (Detritus & Algae Control)  
   - **Freshwater prawns** (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) or **Red Claw Crayfish**  
   - Density: 5–15 juveniles/m² with ceramic/PVC hides  
   - Role: Consume uneaten feed, fish waste, algae → premium edible output  

3. **Mollusk Layer** (Biofiltration & Nutrient Polishing)  
   - Native freshwater mussels or controlled **Corbicula** clams  
   - High density in grow beds and bottom tanks  
   - Role: Filter particulates and excess nutrients; optional harvest (edible in some regions)  

4. **Insect Layer** (Waste Conversion to Feed)  
   - Primary: **Black Soldier Fly Larvae** (BSFL – Hermetia illucens)  
   - Secondary: **Mealworms**, **Crickets** (premium human/edible insect market)  
   - Setup: Dedicated trays fed fish sludge, plant trimmings, livestock manure  
   - Cycle: Weekly harvest → high-protein feed loop back to fish/poultry  

5. **Plant Layer** (Nitrate Uptake & Primary Edible Output)  
   - Greens/herbs/microgreens (8–12 cycles/year)  
   - Staples in flooded trays (rice/potatoes, 3–6 cycles/year)  
   - Vertical racking + floating rafts; CO₂ enrichment from biogas digesters  

## Performance & Economics (Mature Hub, 2035+)

| Metric                             | Value per Pod (Annual)       | Value per Hub (50–100 pods) | Notes |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------|
| Edible Protein Output              | 5–15 tons                    | 250–1,500 tons              | Fish + prawns/crayfish + insects + optional mussels |
| Revenue (Freshwater)               | $300–800K                    | $15–80M                     | Tilapia/catfish/prawns + greens |
| Revenue (Saltwater Pilot)          | $400K–1.5M                   | $20–150M (coastal hubs)     | Barramundi + premium seafood |
| Water Closure                      | 95–99%                       | Network-wide near 100%      | AWG + digestate + recirculation |
| Yield Boost from Microbial Inoculants | +10–30%                    | +$50–200M/hub               | Tailored strains from data moat |
| CAPEX per Pod (Mature)             | $100–200K                    | $5–20M per hub              | Reduced 25% via pre-supply & waste inputs |

## Integration with Genesis Network

- **Pre-Supply**: Delivered pre-seeded (fingerlings, juveniles, BSFL colonies, microbial cultures) from **staging hubs** or partnered greenhouses → first harvest Week 2–4  
- **Waste Loops**: Fish sludge → BSFL → feed; manure from **livestock pods** → digesters → CO₂ for plants  
- **Data Moat**: 50–500 parallel test tanks per hub → ruthless optimization of densities, feeds, temperatures  
- **TerraWell Synergy**: Surplus protein/greens donated → enhanced §170(e)(3) deductions  
- **Resilience**: Airlocks + closed loops enable pandemic/nuclear winter survivability  

## Standards & Compliance

- **Agriculture**: GlobalG.A.P., USDA organic equivalents  
- **Closed-Loop Systems**: NASA-STD-3001 ECLSS principles  
- **Sensors**: IEEE 1451, OGC SWE  
- **Smart Buildings**: ISO/TC 268, ITU-T Y.4900
