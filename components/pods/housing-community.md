# Housing/Community Pod  
**Genesis Network – Residential & Community Module**

The **Housing/Community Pod** is the foundational residential and social unit of the Genesis Network. It provides luxurious, regenerative, self-sufficient living spaces built entirely from **[snap-together toughened ceramic tiles](../components/tiles-catalog.md)** and modular kits. Every structure incorporates **[smart airlocks](../components/smart-airlock-security.md)** for biosecurity and disaster resilience, and supports dense integrated agriculture (balcony/rooftop greens) to contribute to local food production.

## 1. Core Design Principles

- **Construction**: 100% **[ceramic tiles](../components/tiles-catalog.md)** and **[flat-pack kits](../components/kits-catalog.md)** — no conventional concrete, steel framing, or imported lumber  
- **Closure**: 95–99% resource loop (water, energy, waste) via **[ECLSS-inspired systems](../roadmaps/nasa-iss-integration.md)**  
- **Modularity**: Snap-together panels allow rapid assembly, upgrades, and relocation  
- **Resilience**: Vaulted designs (earthquake-resistant), **[Faraday mesh](../components/smart-airlock-security.md)** (EMP protection), water bladders (radiation/thermal shielding)  
- **Biophilic & Dense Agriculture**: Natural light via **[semi-transparent BIPV glazing](../components/tiles-catalog.md)**; balcony/rooftop/vertical greens add **30–50%** productive capacity  
- **Standards Compliance**: ISO/TC 268, ITU-T Y.4900, IEEE 2030, ISO 14001, Cradle-to-Cradle principles  

## 2. Pod Variants & Configurations

| Variant                            | Capacity (Residents) | Key Features                                                                 | Typical Footprint | Cost ($K/unit) | Revenue Potential ($K/year) |
|------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------------------|
| **Single-Family Pod**              | 4–8                  | 2–3 bedrooms, kitchen, living area, balcony greens                           | 40 ft container   | 200–350        | 100–200 (amenities/tourism) |
| **Multi-Family Cluster**           | 12–24                | 4–8 units linked via **[smart pipes](../components/smart-infrastructure.md)** | 2–4 pods          | 600–1,200      | 300–600                     |
| **Community Hub Pod**              | 50–150               | Shared spaces, education **[telepresence](../components/education-telepresence.md)**, **[TerraWell dispensary](../docs/terrawell-freecare.md)** | 5–10 pods         | 1,500–3,000    | 400–1,000 (services)        |
| **Tower Module (Vertical Extension)** | +20–50/floor      | Stacked pods with rooftop gardens, vertical hydroponics                      | 10–20 floors      | +800–1,500/floor | +500–1,200/floor            |

## 3. Smart Airlocks – Mandatory in All Housing/Community Pods

Every entrance includes dual **[smart airlocks](../components/smart-airlock-security.md)**:

- **Scanning**: mmWave + multispectral sensors detect weapons, explosives, pathogens  
- **Sterilization**: UV-C + HEPA filtration; automated lockdown on threat detection  
- **Alert**: AI triggers security response; blockchain logs for audit  
- **Integration**: Linked to **[hyper-dense sensor network](../docs/sensor-handbook.md)** and hub-wide anomaly detection  

## 4. Dense Integrated Agriculture

- **Balcony & Rooftop Greens**: Microgreens, herbs, berries in self-watering ceramic planters  
- **Vertical Hydroponics**: Wall-mounted towers using **[nutrient film technique](../components/pods/aquaponics-multi-trophic.md)**  
- **Contribution**: +30–50% local food capacity; reduces transport needs  
- **Feedback Loop**: Data from **[sensor handbook](../docs/sensor-handbook.md)** optimizes light/nutrient delivery  

## 5. Energy, Water & Waste Systems

- **Power**: **[BIPV glazing](../components/tiles-catalog.md)** + biogas microturbine + sodium-ion batteries (2–5 days autonomy)  
- **Water**: 95–99% closure via AWG, rainwater, digestate recovery  
- **Waste**: Slurry piped to **[biogas digester pods](../components/pods-catalog.md)**; solids to biochar/ceramics  

## 6. Standards & Compliance

- **[ISO 37123](../docs/standards/iso-37123.md)** resilience & smartness maturity  
- **[ISO 14001](../docs/standards/iso-14001.md)** environmental management  
- **[ITU-T Y.4900](../docs/standards/itu-t-y4900.md)** smart sustainable cities KPIs  
- **[Genesis-STD-002](../docs/standards/genesis-std-002.md)** smart airlock protocol  
- **[Genesis-STD-005](../docs/standards/genesis-std-005.md)** disaster recovery framework  

## 7. Integration with Broader Network

- Links to **[livestock pods](../components/pods-catalog.md)** for milk/meat supply  
- **[Aquaponics pods](../components/pods/aquaponics-multi-trophic.md)** for fish/greens  
- **[TerraWell FreeCare](../docs/terrawell-freecare.md)** dispensaries for free healthcare  
- **[Education/Telepresence pods](../components/education-telepresence.md)** for training  
- **[Smart infrastructure](../components/smart-infrastructure.md)** pipes/roads for connectivity
