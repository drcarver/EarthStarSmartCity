# **Biogas & Energy Systems**

The **Biogas & Energy Systems** form the backbone of the **Genesis Network**'s **net-positive energy** architecture, converting organic waste streams into renewable power, heat, digestate nutrients, and CO₂ for enrichment while achieving **95–99% resource closure** and surplus export. All components are modular, pod-based, self-replicating, and lights-out capable, with waste-heat recovery and bidirectional smart-grid integration.

## Core Components

### 1. **Biogas Digester Pods**
- **Capacity Variants**:
  - Small (single pod): 50–150 tons/year wet waste → 100–300 kW continuous
  - Medium cluster (5–10 pods): 500–1,500 tons/year → 1–3 MW
  - Large hub-scale: 5,000–15,000 tons/year → 10–30 MW
- **Feedstocks** (separate streams for optimal methane yield):
  - Livestock manure (cattle/goat/sheep)
  - Aquaponics sludge/fish waste
  - Food/processing residues (pomace, trimmings)
  - Humanure (blackwater from hubs, post-treatment)
  - Green waste (crop residues, landscaping)
- **Design Features**:
  - Anaerobic plug-flow or complete-mix digesters (mesophilic 35–38°C or thermophilic 50–55°C)
  - Ceramic-lined tanks (waste-derived, corrosion-resistant)
  - Automated mixing/pumping via robotic slurry systems
  - Gas collection domes + pressure regulation
  - Leak detection via embedded VOC/acoustic sensors
- **Outputs**:
  - Biomethane (60–70% CH₄) → upgrading to >95% via membrane/PSA
  - Digestate (nutrient-rich slurry) → liquid/solid separation → fertilizer/inoculant feedstock
  - CO₂ stream → greenhouse enrichment or mineralization

### 2. **Microturbines & Power Generation**
- **Primary Units**: Capstone C65/C200 or equivalent (65–200 kW modular)
  - Efficiency: 25–33% electrical + 60–70% total CHP (combined heat & power)
  - Fuel flexibility: raw biogas, upgraded biomethane, syngas
- **Cluster Scaling**: 5–50 units per hub → 0.3–10 MW continuous
- **Heat Recovery**:
  - Exhaust heat exchangers → ceramic thermal mass storage
  - Hot water/steam → greenhouse heating, digester temperature maintenance, aquaculture loops
  - Waste-heat AWG boost → +10–20% water yield
- **Grid Integration**:
  - DC-dominant microgrid (minimal conversion losses)
  - Bidirectional smart pipes → export surplus to partners
  - Black-start capable (battery + biogas ignition)

### 3. **Waste-Heat Recovery & Symbiosis**
- **Capture Points**:
  - Microturbine exhaust (400–600°C)
  - Kiln cooling (ceramic firing)
  - Plasma vitrification off-gas
  - Livestock pod climate systems
- **Distribution**:
  - Ceramic heat exchangers + insulated pipes
  - Thermal mass storage (ceramic water bladders)
  - Priority allocation: digesters > greenhouses > aquaculture > housing
- **Efficiency Gain**:
  - Overall CHP utilization: **80–92%**
  - Energy OPEX reduction: **30–50%**
  - Surplus heat export: **5–15 GWh/year/hub** (district heating)

### 4. **Net-Positive Energy Architecture**
- **Generation Sources** (mature hub):
  - Biogas microturbines: 40–60%
  - Agrivoltaics/BIPV tiles: 30–45%
  - Piezoelectric roads/floors: 5–10%
  - Waste-heat ORC (Organic Rankine Cycle) pilots: 5–10%
- **Consumption Breakdown**:
  - Food production (aquaponics/livestock): 35–45%
  - Manufacturing (TerraFab, kilns): 20–30%
  - Housing/community: 15–25%
  - Infrastructure (pumps, robotics): 10–15%
- **Surplus**: **120–280 GWh/year/hub** → subsidized export to affiliates, grid tie-in (AC conversion only at boundary)
