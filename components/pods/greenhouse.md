# Greenhouse Pod Suite  
**Genesis Network – Core Production Module**

The **Greenhouse Pod Suite** is the primary food and biomass production platform within the **Genesis Network**. Built on modified 40 ft high-cube ISO containers (evolving to 95–100% waste-derived toughened ceramics), it integrates **multi-trophic aquaponics**, **dense vertical agriculture**, **passive climate systems**, and **smart controls** to achieve high yields, near-100% resource closure, and continuous output in diverse climates.

## 1. Base Specifications

- **Form Factor**: 40 ft high-cube ISO container (~300 m² effective growing/holding volume with vertical racking)  
- **Shell Evolution**: Recycled steel → waste-derived toughened ceramics (60–100+ MPa) by 2035  
- **Cladding & Glazing**: Snap-on **[ceramic tiles](../tiles-catalog.md)** with **semi-transparent BIPV glazing** (10–30% transmittance) for natural light + power  
- **Power**: 5–20 kW (BIPV + biogas microturbine + piezo floors); sodium-ion batteries (2–5 days autonomy)  
- **Water**: 100–400 L/day input (AWG + rainwater + digestate recovery); 95–99% recirculation  
- **Airlocks**: Dual smart airlocks with mmWave/multispectral scanning (biosecurity, pathogen detection)  
- **Automation**: Lights-out robotics (feeding, harvesting, pruning); edge RISC-V compute  
- **Monitoring**: Hyper-dense sensors (3–5× redundancy: PAR, humidity, CO₂, VOC, multispectral)  
- **Mobility**: Autonomous relocation; amphibious variants for coastal zones
