# Robotics & Automation Pod  
**Genesis Network Component Specification**

The **Robotics & Automation Pod** is a self-contained, lights-out capable manufacturing and control unit that produces, maintains, and orchestrates the autonomous robotic systems essential to the Genesis Network. It enables full operational independence, reduces human labor to near-zero in mature hubs, and supports exponential replication by manufacturing swarm bots, agricultural drones, maintenance robots, and telepresence units.

## 1. Purpose & Strategic Role

- Produce and service **swarm robotics** for planting, harvesting, weeding, monitoring, shearing, milking, and logistics  
- Manufacture **edge AI controllers** and **RISC-V compute modules** for all pods and infrastructure  
- Enable **lights-out operation** (80–95% automation by 2035) across aquaponics, livestock, processing, and fabs  
- Support **telepresence** and remote oversight to distribute human workload and reduce burnout  
- Provide **disaster recovery** robots for rapid hub repair and relocation  

The pod is a critical enabler of the **[pod-centric architecture](../pods-catalog.md)** and **[data moat](../viability-enhancements.md)** flywheel, turning human oversight into supervisory AI.

## 2. Physical & Manufacturing Specifications

- **Base Unit**: 40 ft high-cube ISO container (evolves to 95–100% **toughened ceramic shell** by 2035)  
- **Manufacturing**: Assembled in **[tile factory pods](../tiles-catalog.md)** using **ceramic structural components**, **embedded conduits**, and **self-produced RISC-V boards** (post-2029 Mini-Fab)  
- **Input Sources**:  
  - Structural: waste-derived ceramics (C&D slag, RHA silica, ELFM slag)  
  - Electronics: recycled silicon wafers + **[Mini-Fab](../financials/capex-revenue-breakdown.md)** output  
  - Actuators/motors: in-house 3D-printed ceramic housings + licensed COTS components early  
- **Power**: 10–30 kW (BIPV + biogas microturbine + sodium-ion batteries)  
- **Climate Control**: Earth tubes + ceramic thermal mass + HEPA filtration  
- **Airlocks**: Dual **[smart airlocks](../smart-airlock-security.md)** with mmWave/multispectral scanning
