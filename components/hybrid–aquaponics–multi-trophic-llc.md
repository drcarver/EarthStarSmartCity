# Hybrid Aquaponics & Multi-Trophic LLC  
**Detailed Specification**

## 1. Overview

The **Hybrid Aquaponics & Multi-Trophic LLC** is responsible for the design, production, optimization, and scaling of the Genesis Network's core food/protein systems. It integrates freshwater (dominant) and limited saltwater multi-trophic aquaponics within **40 ft high-cube pods**, achieving 95–99% resource closure, continuous staggered harvests, and premium edible outputs (greens, fish, prawns/crayfish, insects).

**Key Objectives**  
- Deliver high-yield, resilient protein/greens via layered symbiosis  
- Leverage **data moat** for ruthless optimization (parallel tanks, short cycles)  
- Enable region-specific variants (coastal saltwater, northern cold-water)  
- Generate early/high-margin revenue to support Network self-funding  

This LLC operates within the **innovation hub**'s 19-LLC structure, interfacing with **Ceramic Tile & Infrastructure LLC** (pods/tiles), **Biogas Digester LLC** (energy/sludge), **Livestock LLC** (insect feed), and **Microbial Inoculant LLC** (yield boosts).

## 2. System Design & Multi-Trophic Layers

Pods use vertical racking, floating rafts, and dedicated tanks for layered symbiosis.

| Crustaceans               | Freshwater prawns, Red Claw crayfish                   | 5–18/m²; 4–9 months                   | Detritus cleaners; edible protein                   | Hides for cannibalism control |
| Mollusks                  | Freshwater mussels/clams                               | High-density filtration               | Nutrient stripping; optional harvest                | Ecological buffer |
| Insects                   | BSFL (primary), mealworms, crickets                    | Weekly (BSFL)                         | Waste → feed; human-grade premium                   | Sludge/trimmings feed |
| Plants                    | Greens/herbs/microgreens; staples (rice/taro)          | 8–14 cycles/year                      | Nitrate uptake; high-value produce                  | CO₂ from biogas   |

**Closure Flow**: Fish waste → crustaceans/insects → mollusks → plants → clean water → fish.

## 3. Pod Manufacturing & Economics

- **Manufactured By**: **Tile & Pipe Production LLC** facilities (tent → permanent)  
- **Inputs**: 70–95% waste-derived (slag, RHA silica, residues)  
- **Materials**: Ceramic shell + BIPV glazing + embedded sensors  
- **Production Cost**: $0.8–2.0M per pod  
- **Selling Price (kits/affiliates)**: $1.8–4.5M  
- **Revenue per Mature Pod**: $650k–$2.1M/year (freshwater dominant; higher for saltwater)  
- **Network-Wide (mature)**: $3–12B/year
