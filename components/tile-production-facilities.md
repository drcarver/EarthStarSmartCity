# Tile Production Facilities

**Tile Production Facilities** are the foundational manufacturing backbone of the **Genesis Network**, producing all **toughened ceramic tiles**, **smart infrastructure components**, **pod shells**, and **flat-pack kits**. Facilities evolve from rapid bootstrap setups (leased industrial tents) to permanent, lights-out ceramic factories, achieving 70–95% waste-derived inputs and full **closed-loop** integration.

## 1. Facility Evolution & Timeline

| Phase                     | Timeline     | Facility Type                          | Footprint (m²) | Output Capacity (tiles/month) | CAPEX ($M) | Key Milestones |
|---------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|------------|----------------|
| Bootstrap                 | 2027–2028    | Leased industrial tent + 5–10 pods     | 5,000–10,000   | 50,000–150,000                | 15–35      | Cash-positive Month 3–6; temporary kilns |

## 2. Manufacturing Process

1. **Raw Material Handling**  
   - Inputs stockpiled externally; front-end loaders/conveyors feed mixers  
   - Primary inputs: **C&D slag** (60–75%), **rice husk ash silica** (RHA, 20–80%), farm residues (bagasse, straw, pomace), ELFM slag, brownfield materials  

2. **Mixing & Forming**  
   - High-capacity pan mixers + extruders/automated presses  
   - Embedded features layered in: BIPV thin-film, piezo elements, AWG channels, sensors, Faraday mesh  

3. **Drying & Firing**  
   - Tunnel dryers (waste heat recovery)  
   - High-temperature kilns (1,200–1,400°C; natural gas/electric/biogas)  

4. **Automation & Quality**  
   - Robotic handling, vision-guided stacking  
   - 50–70% lights-out Day 1 → 95% mature  
   - Hyper-dense sensors for real-time monitoring  

5. **Output**  
   - Tiles shipped to pods/kits or external sales  
   - Pods/kits assembled on-site using produced tiles
