# Toughened Ceramic Tiles

**Toughened ceramic tiles** are the foundational building block of the Genesis Network. They are modular, snap-together units manufactured on-site from **waste-derived materials** (70–95% content) and designed for structural, cladding, roofing, and smart infrastructure applications. All tiles integrate active features phased for cash-flow protection and support **smart city standards** (ISO/TC 268, IEEE 2030, ITU-T Y.4900, Matter/Thread/Zigbee) and **sustainable building codes** (passive design, net-zero energy/water, Cradle-to-Cradle principles, LEED-equivalent via embedded sensors).

## Composition & Manufacturing

- **Primary Materials**: Toughened ceramic composite (60–100+ MPa compressive strength)  
- **Waste-Derived Content**: 70–95% from C&D slag, rice husk ash (RHA) silica, farm residues (bagasse, straw, pomace), ELFM slag, brownfield materials  
- **Manufacturing Process**:  
  1. Feedstock intake at **Tile Production Pods**  
  2. Mixing, forming (extrusion/pressing), drying  
  3. High-temperature firing (1,200–1,400°C) in tunnel/shuttle kilns  
  4. Embedding of active features during forming/firing (PZT layers, thin-film PV, sensor embeds, bladder conduits)  
  5. Quality control via hyper-dense sensors + vision-guided stacking  
- **Production Path**: Initial tent kilns → permanent factory clusters (6–12 months retrofit)  
- **Inputs**: C&D slag (primary), RHA silica (high-purity source), farm residues (pore-formers), ELFM slag (toughening)  
- **Cost Range**: Production $1.6–$5.0/ft² (varies by type and feature density); selling price $4.8–$14.0/ft² (premium for smart/active tiles)  
- **Revenue Potential**: $10–$40B/year network-wide (mature); internal zero-cost use + external sales (60–85% margins)
