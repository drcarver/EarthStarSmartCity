# Structural Load-Bearing Tiles  
**Genesis Network Specification**

**Executive Overview**  
Structural Load-Bearing Tiles form the foundational compressive elements of all Genesis buildings, roads, foundations, and heavy infrastructure. Manufactured from 70–95% waste-derived toughened ceramics, they embed piezoelectric vibration harvesting (20–60 elements/m²) and 3–5× redundant strain/pressure/thermal sensors for predictive structural health monitoring. These tiles provide 60–100+ MPa compressive strength, enabling vaulted designs, deep pile integration, and modular snap-together assembly. They are produced in Tile Production Pods and Factories, support self-powered sensor operation, and integrate directly into the network-wide data moat for real-time integrity assessment.

## Viability & Integration Notes

Structural Load-Bearing Tiles are the backbone of all Genesis construction, enabling vaulted, munitions-resistant (8–9/10 rating), and self-monitoring structures with zero legacy materials. Piezoelectric energy harvesting provides micro-power for sensors (self-sustaining arrays), feeding the network-wide data moat for predictive maintenance and optimization. Integration with interconnect kits ensures seamless snap-together assembly and bidirectional utility flow. High compressive strength and waste-derived composition support gigaton sequestration goals while minimizing virgin mining. Primary risk is initial piezo yield consistency (mitigated by parallel testing and data moat iteration). Tiles drive early revenue and enable exponential hub replication.
