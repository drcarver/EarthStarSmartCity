# Structural Load-Bearing Tiles  
**Genesis Network Core Building Component**

**Structural Load-Bearing Tiles** are the foundational elements of all Genesis Network buildings, roads, foundations, and heavy infrastructure. They provide high compressive strength, embedded smart features, and full compatibility with the **pod-centric architecture** while being produced from **70–95% waste-derived materials**.

## Key Characteristics

- **Primary Function**: Serve as structural blocks, foundation bases, load-bearing walls, and heavy-duty flooring/road sub-bases  
- **Compressive Strength**: 60–100+ MPa (exceeding ASTM C216 facing brick and EN 14411 standards)  
- **Embedded Features**: Piezoelectric vibration harvesting (20–60 elements/m²), 3–5× redundant strain/vibration/thermal sensors, embedded conduits for power/data/water/pneumatic lines  
- **Dimensions**: Standard modular sizes (e.g., 600×600 mm, 300×600 mm, custom variants) with interlocking snap-together edges  
- **Weight**: 18–35 kg/m² (depending on thickness 20–60 mm)  
- **Durability**: 50–100+ year service life; resistant to freeze-thaw, chemical attack, abrasion  
- **Fire Rating**: Class A (non-combustible)  
- **EMP/RFI Protection**: Integrated Faraday copper mesh layer  

## Manufacturing Process

Produced exclusively in **Tile Production Pods** using the following steps:

1. **Raw Material Preparation**  
   - Primary inputs: **ELFM slag** (70%), brownfield residues, rice husk ash (RHA) silica  
   - Mobile crushers + plasma vitrification for slag processing  

2. **Mixing & Forming**  
   - High-capacity pan mixers → extrusion or high-pressure pressing  
   - Incorporation of piezoelectric (PZT) layers and sensor embeds during forming  

3. **Drying & Firing**  
   - Tunnel dryers using waste heat recovery  
   - High-temperature tunnel kilns (1,200–1,400°C) for toughening  

4. **Quality Control & Finishing**  
   - Vision-guided robotic stacking  
   - Embedded sensor calibration and testing  

All production lights-out capable with telepresence oversight.
