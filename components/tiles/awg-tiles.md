# Genesis Network – AWG Tiles Spec Sheet

AWG (Atmospheric Water Generation) Tiles are multi-functional, self-powered ceramic modules embedded in roof glazing, exterior cladding, and other surfaces to harvest potable water from humidity, achieving 95–99% closure in the Genesis Network. They integrate condensers, sensors, and microchannels for passive collection/recapture, supporting regenerative water loops while generating revenue through premium sales, leasing, and credits. Manufactured in Tile Production Pods from waste-derived materials, AWG Tiles enhance hub resilience and are deployed in Phase 2 (2029–2031).

## Viability & Integration Notes

AWG Tiles enhance water closure and resilience in the Genesis Network, integrating seamlessly with roof/exterior/interior surfaces for distributed harvesting. Viability: High (9/10) due to passive operation, self-powering, and synergy with sensors/digital twins for optimization. Low-risk revenue from premium water/energy credits; supports smart city (ITU-T Y.4900) and sustainable codes (ISO 14001). Bottlenecks mitigated by tile factory scaling; complements desalination LLC for arid regions.

# Genesis Network – 50-Year Space Roadmap with NASA/ISS Tech Feedback Loops

**EarthStar Technologies** | Version: February 2026 | Prepared for Stakeholders, Partners, and Potential Affiliates

The Genesis Network's 50-year roadmap (2026–2076) integrates Earth-based regenerative hubs with space expansion (Luna, Mars, asteroids, O'Neill cylinders, Von Neumann probes). NASA/ISS-derived tech (e.g., closed-loop life support, hydroponics, radiation shielding from ISS modules like Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, ECLSS systems) is explicitly marked. Feedback loops: Space experiments → data to Earth digital twins/moat for optimization → improved tech deployed to lunar/Mars. Sensor nets enable planning/simulations. Financials recalculated with space uplift (+20–40% revenues from materials/habitats; CAPEX +$200–600B 2040–2070).
