# Genesis Network – Tile Catalog

The Tile Catalog encompasses all waste-derived, multi-functional ceramic tiles central to the Genesis Network's regenerative architecture. Manufactured in Tile & Pipe Production Pods/Factories, these tiles form the structural, intelligent, and productive backbone of hubs, cities, and off-world settlements, embedding power generation, sensing, networking, and storage for closed-loop efficiency.

**Financials**: Network-wide tile revenues $500–1,500B/year mature (60–80% margins); costs reduced 15–25% via efficiencies; IRR +10–20% uplift from smart features/standards compliance.

**Project Phase**: Phase 1 (2027–2029) for core tiles; Phase 2–3 (2030+) for advanced/smart variants.

## Viability & Integration Notes

The Tile Catalog is foundational to Genesis viability, enabling rapid, modular construction with embedded intelligence for energy, sensing, and networking. Integration with pods/kits (e.g., Tile Production Pod) ensures self-replication; smart airlocks enhance security/compliance. High margins (tiles $2–400/unit cost, $7–1,400 revenue) drive self-funding; standards support global adoption. Risks minimal (waste-derived durability); +20–40% viability from data moat optimizations.
