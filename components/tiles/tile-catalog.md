# Genesis Network: Tile Catalog

**Suggested File Path**: components/tiles/tile-catalog.md

## Objective

The tile catalog defines all modular, snap-together tiles used in the Genesis Network for construction, energy, security, and smart functions. All tiles are manufactured in **[Tile & Pipe Production Pods](components/pods/tile-pipe-production-pod.md)** using 70–95% waste-derived toughened ceramics, with blind-mate interconnects for power/data/thermal/water. They support smart city standards (**[ISO/TC 268](docs/standards/iso-tc-268-smart-cities.md)**, IEEE 2030) and sustainable codes (**[ISO 14001](docs/standards/iso-14001-environmental.md)**, Cradle-to-Cradle). Tiles enable all-electric primary energy (sodium-ion storage, BIPV/piezo) with biogas methane backup.

## Financials for Tile Catalog (Network-Wide, Recomputed February 2026 Baseline)

- **Manufacturing CAPEX**: $80–$180M/hub (tile factories; down 5–10% via all-electric efficiencies).
- **Production Costs**: Average $40–$80/m² (waste-derived; volumes 1M+ m²/year/hub).
- **Selling Prices**: Average $150–$300/m² (premiums +20–30% for smart/sustainable features).
- **Annual Revenue**: $150–$450M/year/hub (internal 40–50%, affiliate/external 50–60%; margins 60–80%).
- **Revenue Uplift**: +10–15% ($15–$68M/year/hub) from standards compliance/green credits.
- **IRR Contribution**: +8–12% to network (overall 35–50%).
- **Timeline**: Phase 1 production 2027–2028; mature 2030+ (accelerated 3–6 months via all-electric simplicity).
