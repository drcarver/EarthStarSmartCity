# Medium Wall Panels

**Medium wall panels** are a core structural and functional component of the **Genesis Network**, serving as versatile interior/exterior walls, partitions, acoustic barriers, thermal mass elements, and smart surfaces in housing, community buildings, schools, hospitals, **TerraWell** centers, and industrial pods. Sized for efficient pod-based transport and rapid snap-together assembly, they bridge the gap between small modular tiles and full structural blocks.

## Design & Dimensions

- **Standard Size**: 4 ft × 8 ft × 4–8 in thick (1.22 m × 2.44 m × 10–20 cm) — matches common drywall/plywood handling.
- **Variants**:
  - **Standard Insulating**: 4–6 in thick, high R-value aerated ceramic core.
  - **Thermal Mass**: 6–8 in thick, dense ceramic with embedded water bladders for passive heating/cooling.
  - **Smart Display**: 4–6 in thick, integrated microLED/OLED/QD-OLED + RISC-V compute stack.
  - **Acoustic/Privacy**: 6 in thick, multi-layer with sound-dampening channels.
  - **Load-Bearing**: 8 in thick, reinforced for vertical stacking (up to 10 stories).
- **Edge Profiles**: Tongue-and-groove + magnetic snap-in connectors for zero-gap alignment.
- **Weight**: 40–120 lb/panel (depending on thickness and features) — robotic or two-person install.

## Materials & Composition

- **Primary**: 70–95% waste-derived toughened ceramic (C&D slag, rice husk ash silica, ELFM slag, farm residues, brownfield materials).
- **Additives**:
  - Aerated variants: Bagasse/sugarcane pore-formers.
  - Thermal mass: Integrated water bladders (radiation shielding + thermal storage).
  - Smart variants: Thin-film PV, piezo layers, microLED/OLED arrays, RISC-V compute modules.
- **Finishes**:
  - Interior: Culturally patterned glazes, self-cleaning coatings.
  - Exterior: Weather-resistant, UV-stable, graffiti-resistant surfaces.
- **Embedded Features (all panels)**:
  - Faraday mesh (EMP/RFI protection).
  - Conduits (power, water, data, pneumatic).
  - 3–5× redundant sensors (temperature, humidity, strain, vibration, occupancy).
  - Snap-in podlet slots for future upgrades.

## Manufacturing Process

- **Source**: Produced in **Tile & Pipe Production Pods** → permanent ceramic factories.
- **Steps**:
  1. Raw material mixing (waste-derived aggregates + binders).
  2. Pressing/extrusion into large-format molds.
  3. Drying in tunnel dryers (waste heat recovery).
  4. High-temperature firing (1,200–1,400°C, biogas/natural gas).
  5. Embedding of active features (PV films, piezo, sensors, display layers).
  6. Glazing/patterning (cultural variants).
  7. Robotic inspection, quality control, packaging into kits.
- **Automation**: 90–95% lights-out (robotic handling, vision-guided stacking).
- **Cycle Time**: 24–72 hours per batch (high-throughput tunnel kilns).

## Input Sources & Sustainability

- **Primary Inputs**:
  - C&D waste (slag, concrete fines).
  - Rice husk ash (silica source).
  - Farm residues (bagasse, straw, grape pomace).
  - ELFM/mined landfill slag.
  - Brownfield remediation materials.
- **Secondary**: Recycled electronics (silicon for compute/display), recycled PV films.
- **Closure**: 95–99% waste-derived; zero virgin mining for bulk materials.
