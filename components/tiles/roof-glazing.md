# Housing/Community Kit

**Description**  
The **Housing/Community Kit** provides a complete, modular, snap-together building system for constructing luxurious, resilient, and regenerative residential units, community centers, schools, **TerraWell FreeCare** centers, and related facilities within **Genesis Network** hubs and smallholder mini-hubs. All structures are built exclusively from **toughened ceramic tiles**, **ceramic panels**, and integrated **flat-pack kits** — no conventional concrete, steel framing, or imported materials are required after the initial bootstrap phase.

## Key Features

- **Modular Snap-Together Design**  
  Uses **structural load-bearing tiles** and **insulating tiles** with interlocking edges and embedded conduits for power, water, data, pneumatic delivery, and slurry piping. Allows rapid assembly (days to weeks) and disassembly/relocation if needed.

- **Material Composition**  
  - 70–95% waste-derived: **C&D slag**, **rice husk ash (RHA) silica**, farm residues, **ELFM slag**, brownfield materials  
  - Toughened ceramic matrix (60–100+ MPa compressive strength)  
  - Embedded features: **BIPV glazing** (10–30% transmittance), **AWG channels**, **piezoelectric vibration harvesting**, **Faraday mesh** (EMP/RFI protection), **water bladders** (radiation shielding + thermal mass), cultural/patterned variants  

- **Smart Airlocks (Standard in All Units)**  
  - Dual airlocks at every entry  
  - **mmWave** + **multispectral scanning** for weapons, explosives, pathogens, contraband  
  - AI-triggered alerts to local security + network-wide monitoring  
  - HEPA/UV sterilization + pressure differential for biosecurity  
  - Complies with **NASA-STD-3001** (closed-loop environmental control) adapted for terrestrial use  

- **Integrated Dense Agriculture**  
  - Rooftop, balcony, and vertical wall systems for **greens**, **herbs**, **microgreens**, and small fruiting plants  
  - Adds **30–50%** effective productive capacity without additional land footprint  
  - Uses **semi-transparent BIPV glazing** for natural light + supplemental power  

- **DC-Dominant Appliances & Electronics**  
  - Full suite of in-house **DC-native appliances** (refrigerators, ovens, washers, lighting) powered by hub microgrid  
  - Self-produced edge AI computers and sensors from **Mini-Fab**  

- **Climate & Resilience Features**  
  - Passive-dominant: solar chimneys, earth tubes, windcatchers, ceramic thermal mass  
  - Active supplements: tunable LEDs, waste heat recovery, AI-triggered resistive traces for de-icing  
  - Vaulted ceramic designs rated for high wind/earthquake loads; munitions resistance 8–9/10  

## Manufacturing & Supply

- **Produced in**: **Ceramic Tile Production Pod** and **Modular Ceramic Greenhouse Shell Kit** assembly lines  
- **Input Sources**: 70–95% waste-derived (C&D slag, RHA silica, farm residues, ELFM/brownfield slag)  
- **Assembly**: Flat-pack delivery → robotic or manual snap-together construction; telepresence training via **Education/Telepresence Kit**
