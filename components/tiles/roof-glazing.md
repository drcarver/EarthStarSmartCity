# Roof Glazing Tile  
**Semi-Transparent BIPV Glazing (10–30% Transmittance)**

The **roof glazing tile** is the primary solar and daylighting component in the Genesis Network. It serves as the roof surface for **greenhouse pods**, **housing modules**, **community buildings**, and **vertical farming towers**, combining high natural light transmission with embedded power generation and water harvesting.

## Key Specifications

- **Dimensions**: Standard 600 × 600 mm (modular, snap-together); custom sizes available  
- **Transmittance**: 10–30% visible light (adjustable per application)  
- **Power Output**: 100–300 Wp/m² peak (bifacial thin-film PV layers)  
- **Water Harvesting**: Integrated AWG condensers + sloped channels → 40–70% of daily water needs in arid zones  
- **Thermal Performance**: Low-E coating + ceramic thermal mass → U-value 0.8–1.2 W/m²·K  
- **Durability**: 60–100+ MPa compressive strength; wind/snow load rating EN 12600 Class 2B2  
- **Sensors Embedded**: PAR, thermal, humidity, soiling, strain (3–5× redundancy)  
- **Weight**: 18–25 kg/m² (lightweight glass-ceramic composite)  
- **Lifespan**: 40+ years (minimal degradation <0.5%/year)  

## Manufacturing Process

1. **Substrate**: Rice husk ash (RHA) silica (80%) + farm residues as pore-formers  
2. **PV Integration**: Thin-film deposition (CIGS or perovskite) on semi-transparent glass-ceramic base  
3. **AWG Channels**: Micro-condensers and capillary channels molded during pressing  
4. **Firing**: Tunnel kiln 1,200–1,400°C with plasma vitrification for toughening  
5. **Sensor Embedding**: IEEE 1451-compliant transducers inserted pre-firing  
6. **Final Assembly**: Robotic handling + vision-guided quality control  

**Factory Location**: Produced exclusively in **tile production pods** or permanent ceramic factories (self-replicating kits).

## Input Sources (70–95% Waste-Derived)

- **Primary**: Rice husk ash (silica source), sugarcane bagasse, grape pomace (pore-formers/toughening)  
- **Secondary**: C&D slag, ELFM vitrified slag, brownfield residues  
- **Minimal Virgin**: Trace feldspar/quartz (early bootstrap only)  

## Cost & Revenue (Recalculated Mature Phase)

| Selling Price (Internal) | $8.5–14.0 / m²        | Premium for BIPV + AWG features |
| Selling Price (External/Affiliates) | $10–18 / m²     | +25% uplift from smart features/credits |
| Annual Revenue / Hub    | $8–20M (roof coverage) | Assumes 10,000–20,000 m²/hub |
| Payback Period          | 4–7 years              | Via power generation + water savings |

## Integrated Features & Standards Compliance

- **BIPV**: Semi-transparent thin-film layers (IEC 61215 / IEC 61730)  
- **AWG**: Passive atmospheric water generation channels  
- **Sensors**: PAR/thermal/humidity/soiling/strain (IEEE 1451, OGC SWE)  
- **Smart City Alignment**: ISO/TC 268 KPIs, ITU-T Y.4900, IEEE 2030 grid interop  
- **Sustainability**: ISO 14001, Cradle-to-Cradle principles  
- **Impact Resistance**: EN 12600 (glazing safety)
