The Roof Glazing Semi-Transparent Tile is a multi-functional, waste-derived ceramic module designed for greenhouse roofs, housing, and community structures in the Genesis Network. With 10–30% transmittance, it maximizes natural light for growing zones while generating primary solar power (100–300 Wp/m² peak), harvesting atmospheric water via embedded AWG condensers, and integrating sensors for PAR/thermal/humidity monitoring. Fully compatible with snap-together assembly and blind-mate interconnects, it supports modular, self-powered, regenerative architecture.
