# Insulating / Thermal Mass Tiles  
**Genesis Network Product Specification**

Insulating Tiles are passive-dominant, high-thermal-mass building blocks designed for interior partitions, exterior non-load-bearing walls, and climate-control zones. They provide exceptional energy efficiency through AWG-enabled indoor humidity recapture, micro-piezo motion harvesting for self-powered sensors, and superior thermal inertia that reduces heating/cooling loads by 30–60%. Tiles are 70–95% waste-derived, produced in Tile Production Pods/Factories, and integrate seamlessly into all Genesis structures for near-zero-energy passive climate management.

**Project Phase**: Phase 2 – Early Scale (2029–2031) – full integration into residential/community zones; prioritized after structural/load-bearing tiles.

**Financials (Mature Network, Per Hub, Annual Estimates)**  
- Production Cost: $15–26/m² → $1.5–2.6M per typical 100,000 m² hub build  
- Selling/Transfer Price: $44–75/m² → $4.4–7.5M per hub  
- Hub-Level Revenue (Insulating Tiles only): $15–50M/year (internal + external sales)  
- Network-Wide Revenue Contribution: $15–50B/year (mature phase)  
- Margins: 60–75% (high due to waste-derived inputs & automation)  
- ROI on Production Pod: <18 months

## Viability & Integration Notes

Insulating Tiles are a high-viability, low-risk product: passive-dominant design requires no active power for core function, leverages abundant waste feedstocks, and delivers immediate energy savings (30–60% HVAC reduction). Integration is seamless with all Genesis structures via snap-together modularity. Primary bottlenecks (feedstock consistency, firing energy) are mitigated by microbial inoculant boosts and waste heat recovery from adjacent pods. Tiles support full smart city standards (ISO/TC 268) and sustainable building codes (passive thermal performance, low embodied carbon). Deployment accelerates hub self-funding and resident comfort, making them a foundational element of the regenerative ecosystem.
