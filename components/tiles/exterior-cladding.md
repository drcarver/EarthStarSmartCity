# Exterior Cladding  
**Genesis Network Tile Catalog**

**Exterior Cladding** tiles form the vertical facades of nearly all Genesis structures — pods, hubs, towers, residential modules, **TerraWell FreeCare** centers, and community buildings. They provide structural protection, supplementary power generation, water harvesting, thermal regulation, cultural expression, and embedded intelligence.

## 1. Core Specifications

- **Primary Function**: Vertical weather barrier + active energy/water/sensing layer  
- **Dimensions (standard)**: 600 × 600 mm or 600 × 1200 mm (custom sizes via tile factory)  
- **Thickness**: 20–40 mm (structural variants up to 80 mm)  
- **Weight**: 18–35 kg/m² (depending on thickness and embeds)  
- **Compressive Strength**: 60–100+ MPa (exceeds ASTM C216 facing brick)  
- **Fire Rating**: Non-combustible (Class A)  
- **Durability**: 50–100+ year service life; resistant to UV, freeze-thaw, acid rain, biological growth  

## 2. Manufacturing Process (Tile Factory Pods)

1. **Raw Material Preparation**  
   - Primary input: **C&D slag** (60–70%) + rice husk ash (**RHA silica**) + farm residues (bagasse, straw, grape pomace as pore-formers/toughening agents)  
   - Mixing in high-capacity pan mixers with water + binders  

2. **Forming**  
   - Extrusion or hydraulic pressing into large-format panels  
   - Embedded layers inserted: thin-film PV, AWG channels, strain/vibration sensors, optional cultural patterning  

3. **Drying & Firing**  
   - Tunnel dryers using waste heat recovery  
   - High-temperature firing (1,200–1,400°C) in tunnel kilns; plasma vitrification for slag toughening  

4. **Finishing**  
   - Glazing (optional semi-transparent PV layer)  
   - Quality control: automated vision inspection + sensor calibration  
   - Snap-on mounting channels for facade assembly  

## 3. Active Features Matrix

| Feature                            | Specification                                      | Benefit / Performance                     | Integration Point                     |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Supplementary BIPV**             | Opaque: 15–22% efficiency; Semi-transparent: 8–15% | 40–60% of roof-level power on vertical surfaces | Roof glazing + **smart infrastructure** |
| **AWG (Humidity Capture)**         | Micro-condensers in channels; 0.5–2 L/m²/day       | Indoor humidity recapture + facade cooling | **Water closure** loop                |
| **Strain/Vibration Sensors**       | 3–5× redundancy; ±0.1% accuracy                    | Real-time structural health monitoring    | **Hyper-dense sensor** array          |
| **Cultural / Patterned Options**   | Laser-etched or glazed designs                     | Identity, pride, mental well-being        | Region-specific aesthetic variants    |
| **Thermal Reduction**              | Low thermal conductivity + reflective glazing      | Passive cooling; reduced HVAC load        | **Insulating** layer synergy          |

## 4. Input Sources & Circularity

- **Primary**: **C&D slag** (road construction waste), brownfield/ELFM slag  
- **Secondary**: Rice husk ash (**RHA silica**), sugarcane bagasse, straw, grape pomace  
- **Circularity**: 70–95% waste-derived; end-of-life tiles crushed → RCA base + new feedstock  
- **Virgin Material**: Minimal (binders, glazes) — phased to zero by 2035  

## 5. Cost & Revenue (Recalculated Mature Phase)

| Metric                             | Value (per m²)     | Notes / Drivers                          |
|------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Manufacturing Cost**             | $2.2–4.0           | Reduced 20% via waste inputs + automation |
| **Selling Price (Internal)**       | $7.5–12.5          | Premium for smart features               |
| **Selling Price (External/Affiliate)** | $9.0–15.0       | Cultural variants + certification uplift |
| **Annual Revenue per m² (mature hub)** | $0.8–2.5       | From energy/water savings + credits      |
| **Payback Period**                 | 4–8 years          | BIPV + AWG + sensor self-powering        |

**Hub-Scale Impact**: 50,000–150,000 m² cladding per mature hub → **$375K–$1.9M** direct revenue + **$200K–$500K** indirect (energy/water/credits).
