# Permeable Roads/Paths Tiles  
**Genesis Network Component Specification**

Permeable Roads/Paths Tiles form the internal circulation and drainage backbone of Genesis hubs and regenerative cities. These porous ceramic modules allow stormwater infiltration while generating micro-power via piezoelectric harvesting, embedding sensors for traffic/structural monitoring, and integrating with the smart infrastructure grid for bidirectional utility flow. Manufactured from 75%+ waste-derived materials (primarily C&D slag), they support full closed-loop construction, reduce flooding, recharge aquifers, and provide self-powered edge intelligence.

## Viability & Integration Notes

Permeable Roads/Paths Tiles are a foundational quick-win component: high early revenue (infrastructure contracts), strong regulatory alignment (stormwater compliance), and direct support for hub density. Integration with sensor nets enables real-time maintenance and credits monetization. The tile-first bootstrap model ensures roads are among the first revenue-generating assets in new hubs. Full compliance with smart city standards (ISO/TC 268, IEEE 2030) positions them as a flagship product for affiliate sales and external markets.
