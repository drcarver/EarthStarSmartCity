## Objective

The **[Permeable Road Tile](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1563299796-17596ed6b017?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1200&q=80)** provides durable, drainage-efficient surfaces for roads, paths, and circulation zones in Genesis hubs and cities. It harvests traffic energy via embedded piezo elements, captures stormwater for recharge, and integrates inductive charging for all-electric vehicles (e.g., **[robotaxis](innovation-hub/autonomous-mobility-llc.md)** from Tesla). This tile supports smart city mobility and sustainable infrastructure, aligning with **[ISO/TC 268](docs/standards/iso-tc-268-smart-cities.md)** standards for drainage/resilience and **[ISO 14001](docs/standards/iso-14001-environmental.md)** for permeable, recyclable design.

## Key Functions & Features

- **Permeability & Drainage**: Porous structure allows stormwater infiltration (50–150 mm/hour), reducing flooding and recharging aquifers via integrated channels.
- **Energy Harvest**: Piezo elements (20–60 per m²) generate 2–15 W/m² from traffic/vibration, feeding microgrids or inductive charging.
- **Inductive Charging**: Embedded coils for dynamic charging of electric vehicles (e.g., **Tesla Semi** for freight, **robotaxis** for passengers).
- **Durability**: Toughened ceramic withstands heavy loads (trucks, rail extensions); MIL-STD-810G compliant.
- **Smart Integration**: Embeds for **[RTK GNSS Anchor Tile](components/tiles/rtk-gnss-anchor-tile.md)** positioning, V2X communication, and sensor monitoring.
- **Synergies**: Complements **[Smart Infrastructure Pod](components/pods/smart-infrastructure-pod.md)** for utilities; **[Infrastructure Recycling Kit](components/kits/infrastructure-recycling-kit.md)** for RCA bases under tiles.

## Manufacturing Process

- **Process**: Porous ceramic injection molding → piezo/sensor embedding → blind-mate interconnect lamination → firing (1,200–1,400°C, biogas-powered) → QC.
- **Input Sources**: 75% C&D slag, recycled aggregates (RCA), farm residues.
- **Materials**: Porous ceramic composite + piezo crystals + inductive coils (copper embeds) + sensors.
- **Standards Compliance**: Manufactured to **[ISO 14001](docs/standards/iso-14001-environmental.md)** for low-emission process; recyclable at end-of-life via plasma recovery.

## Recomputed Costs & Revenues (per m², Mature Network, February 2026 Baseline)

- **Production Cost**: $22–$40 (down 5–10% via waste-derived efficiencies; piezo embeds $5–10/m², inductive coils $3–8/m²).
- **Selling Price**: $65–$110 (premium for smart features +20–30%).
- **Annual Revenue Potential (per hub, assuming 200–500k m² roads/paths)**: $10–$50M (infrastructure contracts 60%, energy harvest leasing 20%, charging fees 20%; margins 55–70%).
- **Revenue Uplift from Enhancements**: +10–15% ($1–$7.5M/year/hub) via inductive charging for all-electric fleets and stormwater credits ($50–$150/gallon recharged).
- **IRR Contribution**: +4–7% to network (overall 35–50%).
- **Timeline**: Available in Phase 1 bootstrap (2027–2030); mature yields 2031+.

## List of Sensors in a Separate Table

Embedded sensors for monitoring, compliance, and optimization; support smart city (**[ISO/TC 268](docs/standards/iso-tc-268-smart-cities.md)**) and sustainable codes (**[ISO 14001](docs/standards/iso-14001-environmental.md)**).
