# Roof Glazing Semi-Trans Tile

The Roof Glazing Semi-Trans Tile is a semi-transparent BIPV (building-integrated photovoltaics) ceramic tile designed for greenhouse roofs, housing, and community structures in the Genesis Network. With 10–30% transmittance, it maximizes natural light for growing zones while generating power and capturing water via embedded AWG (atmospheric water generation). Fully self-powered and sensor-integrated, it enhances regenerative closure, enables early revenue from premium daylighting + energy, and scales via modular snap-together assembly.
