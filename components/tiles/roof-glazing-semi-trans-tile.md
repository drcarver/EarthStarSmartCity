The Roof Glazing (Semi-Trans) Tile is a semi-transparent BIPV glazing component (10–30% transmittance) designed for greenhouse roofs, housing/community roofs, and growing pods. It maximizes natural light for photosynthesis while generating power via thin-film PV, capturing water through embedded AWG condensers, and integrating sensors for environmental monitoring. Manufactured from waste-derived materials, it supports regenerative closure and is snap-together modular for rapid deployment.

## Viability & Integration Notes

The Roof Glazing (Semi-Trans) Tile is highly viable (9/10) as a core revenue driver, integrating seamlessly with greenhouse/aquaponics pods and vertical farming kits for daylighting + power + water. Embedded sensors feed the data moat for AI optimization; supports smart city standards (ISO/TC 268) and sustainable codes (ISO 14001). Enhances closure by capturing atmospheric water for cooling/irrigation; cultural variants available for global adaptations.
