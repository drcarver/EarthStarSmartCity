## Objective

The **[Roof Glazing Tile](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1600585154340-be6161a56a0c?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1200&q=80)** provides power generation, daylighting, and water harvest for Genesis hubs and buildings, integrating seamlessly with the all-electric primary energy system (sodium-ion batteries, inductive charging) and biogas methane backup. It supports **[Sustainable Energy LLC](../../innovation-hub/sustainable-energy-llc.md)** microgrids, enhances **[Vertical Ag Expansion Kit](..//kits/vertical-ag-expansion-kit.md)** efficiency, and complies with smart city standards (**[ISO/TC 268](../../docs/standards/iso-tc-268.md)**) and sustainable codes (**[ISO 14001](../../docs/standards/iso-14001.md)**). All buildings using this tile incorporate **[Smart Airlock Kit](../kits/smart-airlock-kit.md)** for security (weapons/explosives scans + alerts).

## Key Functions & Features

- **Power Generation**: Semi-transparent **BIPV** (10–30% efficiency) for all-electric systems.
- **Daylighting & Water Harvest**: AWG condensers + PAR/thermal sensors for water sovereignty.
- **Synergies**: Feeds surplus to **[Energy Storage & Thermal Tile](energy-storage-thermal-tile.md)**; condensate to **[Aquaponics Pod](../pods/aquaponics-pod.md)**; data to **[digital twins](../../docs/digital-twins.md)** for optimization.
- **All-Electric Integration**: Compatible with inductive charging/microgrids; no hydrogen dependency.
- **Smart Airlocks**: Mandatory in all buildings; mmWave/hyperspectral + trace detectors for threats.

## Manufacturing Process

- Location: **[Tile & Pipe Production Pod](../pods/tile-pipe-production-pod.md)** → permanent factories.
- Process: Ceramic injection molding → **BIPV** lamination → sensor embedding → blind-mate socket integration → final firing/QC.
- Inputs: 70–95% waste-derived (RHA silica 80%, C&D slag, farm residues).
- Materials: Glass-ceramic composite + thin-film PV layers; toughened for durability (MIL-STD-810G).

## Recomputed Costs & Revenues (per m², February 2026 Baseline)

- **Prod Cost**: $28–55 (down 5–10% via waste efficiencies; all-electric simplifies embeds).
- **Selling Price**: $85–$150 (premium for sustainable codes compliance).
- **Revenue Model**: Energy export (50%), water credits (20%), retail/construction sales (30%); margins 60–75%.
- **Annual Revenue Potential**: $100–$300M/hub (assuming 10,000–20,000 m² roof area; +10–15% uplift from all-electric synergies reducing OPEX).
- **CAPEX Impact**: $20–$50M/hub for deployment; payback 2–4 years.
- **IRR Contribution**: +4–8% to network (overall 35–50%).
- **Timeline**: Available Phase 1 (2026–2028); mature production 2030+.
