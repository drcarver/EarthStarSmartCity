# Genesis Network: **Standards Compliance Tile**

## Objective

The **Standards Compliance Tile** is an embedded monitoring tile designed to ensure real-time verification and reporting for smart city standards (**[ISO/TC 268](docs/standards/iso-tc-268-smart-cities.md)**, IEEE 2030, ITU-T Y.4900, Matter/Thread) and sustainable building codes (**[ISO 14001](docs/standards/iso-14001-environmental.md)**, Cradle-to-Cradle). It integrates sensors, blockchain logging, and AI for automated audits, enabling verifiable credits, compliance certifications, and reduced regulatory risks across all Network structures.

## Key Features & Synergies

- **Compliance Monitoring**: Tracks metrics like energy efficiency, emissions, water usage, structural integrity, and security.
- **Audit Automation**: Blockchain-verified logs for carbon/biodiversity credits; AI anomaly detection/alerts.
- **Synergies**: Integrates with **[Dense Sensor Net Kit](components/kits/dense-sensor-net-kit.md)** for data aggregation; feeds **[digital twins](docs/digital-twins.md)**; supports **[Smart Airlock Module Tile](components/tiles/smart-airlock-module-tile.md)** for security compliance; used in all buildings for **[Sustainable Code Tile](components/tiles/sustainable-code-tile.md)** synergy.
- **All-Electric Alignment**: Monitors sodium-ion battery performance and electric grid metrics; biogas methane backup detection for resilience reporting.

## Manufacturing Process

- Location: **[Tile & Pipe Production Pods](components/pods/tile-pipe-production-pod.md)** → permanent tile factories.
- Inputs: 70–95% waste-derived (C&D slag, RHA silica, electronics from **[Advanced Fab LLC](innovation-hub/advanced-fab-llc.md)**).
- Materials: Toughened ceramic composite with sensor embeds and blockchain chips.
- Process: Molding → sensor lamination → firing (1,200–1,400°C, biogas-powered) → QC with AI/vision.
- Size: 600 × 600 mm (standard); thickness 20–35 mm.

## Recomputed Costs & Revenues (February 2026 Baseline)

- **Prod Cost ($/m² mature)**: 45–90 (down 5–10% via waste synergies).
- **Selling Price ($/m²)**: 150–350.
- **Revenue Model**: Compliance credits/audits (50%), certification services (30%), internal Network use (20%); margins 60–75%.
- **Annual Revenue Potential ($M/hub)**: 100–250 (uplift +10–15% from automated reporting/credits at $150–250/tCO₂e).
- **CAPEX Contribution**: Minimal add-on ($20–50M/hub for deployment); ROI <1 year via regulatory speed-ups.
- **Viability Impact**: +5–10% (faster permitting, reduced fines); integrates with all-electric shift for energy metric tracking.
