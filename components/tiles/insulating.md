# Insulating Tiles  
**Genesis Network – Component Specification**  
**Version: 1.0 | Date: January 21, 2026**

## Overview

**Insulating tiles** are a core structural and thermal component in the Genesis Network. They provide high thermal mass, passive climate control, indoor humidity recapture via embedded **AWG channels**, and micro-power generation through occupancy motion. These tiles are used extensively in walls, partitions, and non-load-bearing interior surfaces of housing, community buildings, schools, and TerraWell centers.

They complement **structural load-bearing tiles** and **roof glazing** to create fully ceramic, waste-derived buildings with integrated smart features.

## Key Features

- **Thermal mass & insulation**: High R-value equivalent via aerated ceramic matrix  
- **Indoor AWG**: Embedded channels recapture humidity from respiration, cooking, and evapotranspiration  
- **Micro-piezoelectric generation**: Converts occupancy motion into low-power for sensors/lighting  
- **Embedded sensors**: Temperature, humidity, strain, and microbial activity monitoring  
- **Cultural/patterned variants**: Aesthetic designs for residential/community zones  
- **Snap-together integration**: Compatible with **smart ceramic pipes** and **airlock modules**  

## Manufacturing Process

All **insulating tiles** are produced in **tile production pods** within the Genesis hubs:

1. **Raw material mixing**: Aerated ceramic base (bagasse pore-formers + rice husk ash silica + fly ash)  
2. **Forming**: High-pressure extrusion or pressing into standard sizes (e.g., 600×600 mm, 300×600 mm)  
3. **Drying**: Tunnel dryers using waste heat recovery  
4. **Firing**: Tunnel kilns at 1,100–1,300°C (biogas or syngas fueled)  
5. **Embedding**: Post-firing insertion of AWG micro-channels, piezo layers, and sensor arrays  
6. **Quality control**: Multispectral scanning + strain testing  

**Production rate (mature hub)**: 200,000–500,000 m²/year  
**Waste-derived content**: 75–90% (bagasse, RHA, fly ash, recycled ceramic fines)
