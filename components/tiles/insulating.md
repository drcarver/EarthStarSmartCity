# Insulating Tiles  
**Genesis Network Component Specification**

**Insulating Tiles** are a core structural and thermal component in the **Genesis Network**'s **[pod-centric architecture](../pods-catalog.md)** and regenerative city design. They provide high thermal mass, indoor humidity recapture, passive climate control, and embedded smart features while being manufactured from **70–95% waste-derived materials**.

## 1. Purpose & Applications

- Primary use: Thermal insulation and mass in walls, partitions, and internal structural elements  
- Key functions:  
  - Passive heating/cooling via high thermal inertia  
  - Indoor **AWG** (atmospheric water generation) for humidity recapture  
  - Micro-power generation from occupancy motion via piezoelectric elements  
  - Embedded sensors for indoor environmental monitoring  
  - Aesthetic and cultural patterning options  

Common applications:  
- Internal walls and partitions in housing/community pods  
- Vaulted ceilings in **[greenhouse/aquaponics pods](../pods-catalog.md)**  
- Thermal mass layers in **[livestock pods](../pods-catalog.md)** and processing facilities  
- Retrofitting existing structures during brownfield remediation  

## 2. Manufacturing Process

All **insulating tiles** are produced exclusively in **[tile factory pods](../tiles-catalog.md)** using the following steps:

1. **Raw Material Preparation**  
   - Primary inputs: sugarcane bagasse and rice straw as pore-forming agents, rice husk ash (RHA) for silica, minor clay/feldspar (early phase)  
   - Waste-derived share: **80–95%** (mature phase)  

2. **Mixing & Aeration**  
   - High-shear mixers combine materials with controlled foaming agents  
   - Porosity engineered for insulation (thermal conductivity 0.08–0.15 W/m·K)  

3. **Forming**  
   - Hydraulic presses or extrusion for flat or contoured shapes  
   - Sizes: standard 600×600 mm, 300×600 mm; custom modular cuts  

4. **Drying & Firing**  
   - Tunnel dryers using waste heat recovery  
   - High-temperature shuttle/tunnel kilns (1,100–1,250°C)  
   - Embedded features (piezo layers, AWG channels, sensor conduits) inserted pre-firing  

5. **Post-Processing**  
   - Surface treatments (glazing optional for aesthetics)  
   - Quality control via embedded strain/thermal sensors  
   - Packaging as flat-pack kits

|------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------|
| Production Cost                    | $1.7–3.0 / ft²    | $1.4–2.5 / ft²       | 20% reduction via waste inputs & automation |
