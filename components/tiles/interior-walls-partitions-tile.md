## Objective

The **Interior Insulating Partition** tile provides thermal mass, sound insulation, and indoor humidity recapture for residential, community, and productive buildings in the Genesis Network. It integrates with the all-electric primary energy system, embedding features for energy efficiency and sensor monitoring, while supporting smart city standards (**[ISO/TC 268](docs/standards/iso-tc-268-smart-cities.md)**) and sustainable building codes (**[ISO 14001](docs/standards/iso-14001-environmental.md)**).

## Key Functions & Features

- **Insulation & Thermal Buffering**: High R-value aerated ceramic core reduces heating/cooling needs by 20–40%.
- **Humidity Recapture**: Embedded **[AWG & Condensate Recovery](components/energy-water-closure-systems.md)** microchannels capture indoor moisture for reuse.
- **Embedded Intelligence**: Micro-piezo for energy harvesting, thermal sensors for optimization.
- **Synergies**: Used in **[Food Desert Housing Starter Kit](components/kits/food-desert-housing-starter-kit.md)** walls; integrates with **[Energy Storage & Thermal Tile](components/tiles/energy-storage-thermal-tile.md)** for heat buffering; supports **[Smart Airlock Kit](components/kits/smart-airlock-kit.md)** in all buildings.

## Manufacturing Process

- Location: **[Tile & Pipe Production Pods](components/pods/tile-pipe-production-pod.md)** → permanent factories.
- Process: Feedstock mixing → aeration molding → channel/sensor embedding → firing (1,200–1,400°C, biogas-powered) → QC via AI/vision.
- Inputs: 70–95% waste-derived (residues, bagasse for aeration).
- Materials: Aerated ceramic composite + embedded channels/piezo/sensors.

## Recomputed Costs & Revenues (February 2026 Baseline)

- **Production Cost**: $18–$35/m² (mature; down 5–10% via waste efficiencies).
- **Selling Price**: $55–$100/m² (premium for embedded features).
- **Revenue Model**: Housing kits (60%), internal hub use (30%), affiliate sales (10%); margins 60–75%.
- **Annual Revenue Potential**: $50–$150M/hub (from kit integrations); network-wide $20–$60B/year (2050).
- **CAPEX Impact**: Minimal ($20–$50M/hub for production line); payback 6–12 months.
- **Revenue Uplift**: +10–15% from all-electric synergies (piezo harvesting feeds sodium-ion storage).
