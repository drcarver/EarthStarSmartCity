The Interior Walls/Partitions Tile is a multifunctional, self-powered ceramic component designed for indoor partitioning in Genesis hubs, residences, and community buildings. It integrates indoor atmospheric water generation (AWG) for humidity recapture, micro-power harvesting, and embedded sensors for thermal/humidity monitoring, enabling closed-loop water systems and passive climate control while contributing to the Network's data moat for AI optimization.
