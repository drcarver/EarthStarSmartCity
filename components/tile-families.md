# Tile Families – Master Specification

**Version**: Consolidated Master – January 2026  
**Core Principle**: Every structure in the Genesis Network (pods, buildings, roads, infrastructure) is constructed exclusively from **toughened ceramic tiles** and self-replicating kits produced within the Tile & Pipe Production Pod → permanent ceramic factories. No virgin concrete, steel, or asphalt is permitted beyond minimal recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) bases where structurally required.

All tiles are **95%+ waste-derived**, multi-functional, intelligent modules with embedded active features, designed for 60–100+ MPa compressive strength, 70–95% resource closure, and full smart-city interoperability.

## 1. Manufacturing & Input Summary (All Tiles)

- **Primary Production Path**: Tile & Pipe Production Pod → permanent cylindrical ceramic factories  
- **Process**: Raw material mixing → extrusion/pressing → tunnel drying → high-temperature firing (1,200–1,400°C, biogas/natural gas) → robotic embedding of active features → quality inspection → packaging  
- **Energy**: Biogas microturbines + BIPV roof arrays + waste heat recovery  
- **Water**: 95–99% closure via AWG + digestate recovery  
- **Automation**: 80–95% lights-out (robotic handling, vision-guided stacking)  
- **Primary Inputs (95%+ waste-derived)**:  
  - C&D slag (structural base)  
  - Rice husk ash (RHA) silica (glazing, high-purity)  
  - Farm residues (bagasse, straw, grape pomace – pore-formers, toughening agents)  
  - ELFM slag & brownfield materials (70–95% at maturity)  
  - Recycled electronics (silicon for sensors/display layers)
