# Genesis Network – Pods Catalog

**Version Date:** January 2026

All pods are based on modified **40 ft high-cube ISO containers** (12.192 m × 2.438 m × 2.896 m), upgraded to **toughened ceramic shells** (70–100% waste-derived) for durability, munitions resistance (8–9/10), and **95–99% resource closure**. Pods are the foundational unit: every function starts in pods for rapid bootstrap, mobility, and resilience before any fixed-structure transition.

**Universal Pod Features**:
- **Power**: BIPV cladding + biogas microturbine (5–20 kW), sodium-ion batteries (2–5 days autonomy).
- **Water**: AWG + rainwater + digestate recovery (95–99% closure).
- **Security**: Dual **smart airlocks** with mmWave/hyperspectral scanning (weapons/explosives/pathogens); AI alerts.
- **Sensors**: 3–5× redundancy (multispectral, strain, VOC, radar); RISC-V edge AI.
- **Automation**: Lights-out capable (50–70% Day 1 → 80–95% mature).
- **Mobility**: Autonomous wheeled/tracked movers; stacking frames (3–10 stories); amphibious/underground variants.
- **Interconnect**: Smart ceramic pipes (bidirectional power/water/waste/data).
- **Manufacturing**: Produced in **Tile Production Pods** → permanent factories (retrofit); all from waste-derived ceramics.

## Pod Manufacturing & Integration Notes

- **Production**: All pods built using **Tile Production Pods** → permanent factories. Ceramic shells replace steel (waste-derived).
- **Pre-Supply**: Nearly mature pods (stocked with animals/feed/starters) from staging/mother hubs → bootstrap in days/weeks.
- **Transition**: Pods remain primary; fixed structures only when scale demands (e.g., herds >100 animals).
- **Integration**: Smart ceramic pipes connect all pods; bidirectional flow (power/water/waste/data); sensor nets feed local digital twins.

## Pod Resilience & Standards Compliance

- **Disaster Resilience**: Vaulted ceramics, airlocks, mobility, closure → high rating (7–9/10 for most scenarios).
- **Smart City Standards**: ISO/TC 268, IEEE 2030, ITU-T Y.4900 (interoperability, KPIs).
- **Sustainable Codes**: Cradle-to-Cradle, ISO 14001 (environmental management).

This catalog represents the complete set of pods required for full network operation and replication.
