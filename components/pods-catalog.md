# Pods Catalog  
**Genesis Network – Core Modular Components**

All **pods** in the Genesis Network are based on modified **40 ft high-cube ISO containers**, designed for rapid bootstrap, mobility, resilience, lights-out automation, and **95–99% resource closure**. Early versions use recycled steel; mature versions transition to **95–100% waste-derived toughened ceramics** (from **C&D slag**, **rice husk ash**, **farm residues**, **ELFM slag**). Pods interconnect via **smart ceramic pipes** (bidirectional power/water/waste/data/slurry/bee transit).

Pods are manufactured in **tile factory pods** (self-replicating kilns, extruders, robotic assembly) and delivered pre-seeded/pre-stocked from staging hubs or partnered greenhouses.

All pods integrate **[smart airlocks](../components/smart-airlock-security.md)** with mmWave/multispectral scanning for weapons/explosives/pathogens and AI alerts.

## Pod Manufacturing & Integration Notes

- All pods built from **[tile factory pods](pods/tile-production-pod.md)** (self-replicating kilns/extruders/robotic handling)  
- Input sources: **70–95% waste-derived** (C&D slag, rice husk ash, farm residues, ELFM/brownfield slag)
