# Pods Catalog  
**Genesis Network Component Specifications**

All pods in the Genesis Network follow the **pod-centric architecture** — standardized 40 ft high-cube ISO container bases (evolving to waste-derived toughened ceramics), modular, mobile, lights-out capable, and interconnected via **smart infrastructure** pipes. Pods are manufactured in **ceramic tile production** facilities using 70–95% waste-derived inputs (C&D slag, rice husk ash, farm residues, ELFM/brownfield slag).  

Every pod includes:  
- BIPV glazing (10–30% transmittance)  
- Embedded sensors (3–5× redundancy)  
- Dual **smart airlocks** (mmWave/multispectral scanning for biosecurity/pathogens/weapons)  
- Edge RISC-V compute for local AI processing  
- 95–99% resource closure (water, nutrients, energy)
