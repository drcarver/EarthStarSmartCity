# Restoration & Blue-Green Carbon

The **[Restoration & Blue-Green Carbon](components/restoration-blue-green-carbon.md)** module deploys modular, self-replicating flat-pack kits to restore degraded ecosystems and generate high-value carbon/biodiversity credits while enhancing coastal protection, water quality, fisheries, and biodiversity corridors. All restoration activities are executed using **Genesis** ceramic tiles, pipes, and kits, ensuring **95–99% resource closure** and alignment with regenerative principles.

## Core Objectives

- Achieve gigaton-scale carbon sequestration through blue-green ecosystems.
- Remediate coastal and riverine brownfields/landfills.
- Support fisheries and biodiversity via native species restoration.
- Generate verifiable credits (VCS/Plan Vivo-aligned, $130–250/tCO₂e equivalent).
- Provide rapid-deployment kits for disaster recovery and community-led projects.

## Restoration Kit Families

All kits are produced in **Tile & Pipe Production Pods** and delivered via flat-pack containers with instructions, digital twins, initial stock, and sensors.

**Total Sequestration Potential (mature network, 8,000 hubs + partners)**: 0.5–2 GtCO₂e/year (blue-green + biochar/agroforestry synergy).

## Manufacturing & Input Sources

- **Primary Production**: **Tile & Pipe Production Pods** → permanent ceramic factories.  
- **Inputs (95%+ waste-derived)**:  
  - Ceramic shells/reef balls: C&D slag, ELFM slag, rice husk ash, brownfield residues.  
  - Anchor lines/stakes: Recycled steel or ceramic composites.  
  - Sensors/buoys: TerraFab recycled silicon + BIPV.  
  - Native stock: Partnered greenhouses + hub hatcheries (fish/spat/seedlings).  
- **Energy**: Biogas microturbines + BIPV + waste heat recovery.  
- **Water**: 95–99% closure via AWG + digestate recovery.

## Integration with Livestock Pods & Hubs

- **Silvopasture linkage**: Mangrove/salt marsh buffers protect grazing zones from storm surge/salinity intrusion.  
- **Manure synergy**: Livestock waste → microbial inoculants → enhanced wetland plant growth.  
- **Beehive pods**: Pollinate coastal flowering species (e.g., Spartina, mangrove associates).  
- **Restoration zones**: 15% hub area dedicated → biodiversity corridors connect hubs → wildlife migration + credit stacking.

## Financial & Timeline Impacts

- **CAPEX Addition per Hub**: $0.5–1.5B (kits + deployment over 10–20 years).  
- **Revenue Uplift**: $0.4–1.5B/year/hub (credits + fisheries/ecotourism).  
- **Timeline Acceleration**:  
  - Credits monetized within **1–3 years** of deployment (faster than tree carbon).  
  - Coastal protection reduces disaster recovery CAPEX **20–40%**.  
  - Overall hub maturity: **1–2 years faster** due to diversified revenue.
