# Mini-Fab  
**Sovereign Chip & Sensor Manufacturing in the Genesis Network**

The **[Mini-Fab](../components/mini-fab.md)** is the Genesis Network’s modular, pod-cluster-based semiconductor and sensor fabrication facility. It produces mature-node (65–130 nm) sensors, edge AI chips, and robotics controllers in-house starting late 2029, with phased upgrades to advanced nodes (7 nm → 3 nm) after strict triggers. The system is designed for **lights-out** operation (80–95% automation by 2035), **regenerative closure** (70–95% waste-derived inputs), and **sovereign control** — ensuring the network remains independent of external semiconductor supply chains.

## 1. Purpose & Strategic Role

- Eliminate supply chain risk for critical sensors, AI, and robotics components  
- Enable **data moat** acceleration (dense, redundant sensor arrays)  
- Generate high-margin revenue from internal use and external sales  
- Support **[NASA/ISS integration](../roadmaps/nasa-iss-integration.md)** and lunar/Mars ECLSS/BLSS systems  
- Align with **[Fortress West](../roadmaps/fortress-west-expansion.md)** defensive resilience requirements  

## 2. Phased Construction & Technology Progression

| Phase                  | Timeline       | Node / Cleanroom Level | Key Capabilities                              | CAPEX per Hub ($M) | Revenue per Hub ($M/year) |
|------------------------|----------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| **Phase 1 – Mini-Fab** | Late 2029–2032 | 65–130 nm / ISO 7–8    | Sensors, edge RISC-V AI, robot controllers    | 100–300            | 200–500                   |
| **Phase 2 – Optimization** | 2030–2035   | 65–45 nm / ISO 6       | Higher density sensors, basic SoCs            | 200–500 (add-on)   | +300–700                  |
| **Phase 3 – Advanced Pilot** | 2032–2035 | 7 nm / ISO 5 critical zones | AI accelerators, advanced robotics            | 2–4B (cluster)     | 500–1,000+                |
| **Phase 4 – Mature Advanced** | 2035+      | 3 nm / ISO 5           | Full sovereign niche chip production          | 3–8B (cluster)     | 500–1,500+                |

**Triggers for Advancement**  
- Sustained cash flow ≥6 months  
- ≥8–15 operational hubs  
- Cumulative cash ≥$100M+  
- Excess biogas/syngas availability  

## 3. Manufacturing & Materials

- **Bootstrap**: Leased tents (5,000–15,000 m²) → 5–10 recycled steel pods → ceramic shells (95% waste-derived)  
- **Inputs**: 70–95% waste-derived (C&D slag, rice husk ash silica, ELFM slag, brownfield materials)  
- **Tools**: Licensed DUV lithography (Phase 1); in-house plasma refining, LCM 3D-printed fixtures (20–30%)  
- **Power/Water**: Biogas microturbine + BIPV + sodium-ion batteries; AWG + digestate recovery  
- **Automation**: 50–70% lights-out initially → 90–95% by Phase 4 (swarm robotics, AI predictive maintenance)  

## 4. Sensor Integration & Data Moat

The **[Mini-Fab](../components/mini-fab.md)** produces hyper-dense sensors for the **[data moat](../docs/data-moat.md)**:

| Sensor Type                        | Node Requirement | Primary Application                           | Cost per Unit ($) | Annual Production (Units/hub) |
|------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Electrochemical/Optical            | 65–130 nm        | Nutrient/pH/pathogen in aquaponics            | 10–20            | 50,000–200,000                |
