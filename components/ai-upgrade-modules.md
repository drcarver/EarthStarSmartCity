## Overview

**AI Upgrade Modules** are hot-swappable, standardized add-ons that transform base **[Compute Server Tiles](tiles/compute-server-tile.md)** from minimal-function sensor nodes into full distributed intelligence platforms. They enable:

- On-tile edge inference  
- Federated learning participation  
- Local digital twin execution  
- Predictive maintenance & optimization  
- Cluster-level swarm intelligence  

Modules are **fully optional** — base tiles ship functional for immediate revenue, while upgrades provide high-margin evolution. All modules are manufactured in **[Mini-Fab Pods](../pods/mini-fab-pod.md)** using the same waste-derived processes as other electronics.

**Key Principles**  
- **Deferred CAPEX** — Pay for intelligence only when needed  
- **Hot-swappable** — 30–60 second field upgrade (no downtime)  
- **Federated & sovereign** — Local twins control data export  
- **Progressive capability** — Tiered modules scale with Network maturity  

## Physical & Interface Specification

- **Footprint**: Identical to compute/storage module (100 × 100 × 10–15 mm)  
- **Interface**: Blind-mate military-grade (power, data, cooling) — shared pocket with **[Compute Module](tiles/compute-server-tile.md)**  
- **Cooling**: Tile microchannel loop (AWG-sourced water)  
- **Power**: 8–45 W (drawn from tile inductive/PoE fabric)  
- **Retention**: Magnetic + mechanical latch (tool-less)  

## AI Upgrade Module Tiers

| Tier                        | Timeline Availability | Process Node | Cores / Architecture | On-Module RAM | TDP (W) | Primary Capabilities                                      | Est. Cost ($/unit) | Selling Price ($/unit) | Gross Margin |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------|--------------|-----------------------|---------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| **Basic Inference Module**  | 2029–2032             | 65–28 nm     | 4–8 RISC-V            | 4–16 GB       | 8–15    | Edge inference, local twin mini-batches, anomaly detection | 120–280             | 350–800                 | 65–78%       |
| **Cluster Intelligence**    | 2033–2038             | 28–7 nm      | 8–16 RISC-V + NPU     | 16–64 GB      | 15–30   | Federated learning, swarm coordination, predictive optimization | 450–1,200           | 1,200–3,500             | 68–82%       |
| **Server-Class Node**       | 2039–2045+            | 7–3 nm       | 16–32 RISC-V + advanced NPU | 64–256 GB     | 30–45   | On-tile small LLM inference, full twin training, agentic pipelines | 1,800–5,000         | 5,000–15,000            | 72–85%       |

**Upgrade Pathway**  
- Modules slot into existing **[Compute Server Tile](tiles/compute-server-tile.md)** pockets  
- Firmware over-the-air + federated updates  
- Backward compatible — old modules remain functional as sensor nodes  

## Integration with Dense Sensor Network

AI modules process data from the **[Dense Sensor Net](../docs/sensors/dense-sensor-net.md)** in real-time:

- **Input Fusion**: 3–5× redundant streams (environmental, structural, biological)  
- **Edge Processing**: Anomaly detection, predictive yields, maintenance alerts  
- **Federated Output**: Anonymized model improvements shared hub-wide/globally  
- **Off-World Ready**: Hardened for radiation/dust (lunar/Mars variants post-2040)

- **Materials**: 70–95% waste-derived ceramics + recycled electronics  
- **CAPEX per Module Line**: $80–$250M (phased)  
- **Revenue (mature network, 2040s)**: **$12–$48B/year** (upgrades + recurring firmware)  
- **Margins**: 65–85% (high due to software/firmware component)  

## Viability Enhancements

- **Deferred intelligence** reduces early risk/cost  
- **Hot-swap** enables continuous revenue during upgrades  
- **Federated model** preserves privacy/sovereignty  
- **Sensor synergy** turns data moat into direct intelligence value
