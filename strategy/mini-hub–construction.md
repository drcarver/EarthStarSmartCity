# Genesis Network: Building a Mini-Hub – From Initial Survey to Maturity

## Overview

A **mini-hub** is a smaller-scale Genesis site (typically 5–60 hectares) developed by smallholder farmers, co-ops, or affiliates using **[starter kits](components/kits/food-desert-housing-starter-kit.md)**, **[precision ag starter kits](components/kits/precision-ag-starter-kit.md)**, and modular **[tiles](components/tiles.md)**/**[pods](components/pods.md)**. It follows the same 4-zone regenerative model as full hubs but is designed for rapid deployment, low initial CAPEX, and self-funding within 6–18 months.

Mini-hubs serve as distributed nodes that supply food, energy, water, and services to nearby communities, while feeding surplus into larger hubs. They are the primary vehicle for exponential scaling beyond the initial corporate-led hubs.

## Phases & Milestones (Typical Timeline: 12–24 Months to Maturity)

### Phase 0: Pre-Survey & Site Selection (Months -3 to 0)
- **Activities**:
  - Affiliate/co-op identifies distressed land (brownfield, degraded farmland, food desert edge).
  - Submit site data to **[OS & Software LLC](innovation-hub/os-software-llc.md)** digital twin for analysis.
  - Confirm suitability: soil remediation potential, water access, solar/piezo viability, community support.
- **Milestone**: Site approved; grant/loan application filed (USDA REAP, EPA Brownfields, HUD CDBG).
- **Cost**: $10k–$50k (surveys, legal, initial testing).
- **Key Kit**: **[Dense Sensor Net Kit](components/kits/dense-sensor-net-kit.md)** for baseline mapping.

### Phase 1: Initial Survey & Remediation (Months 1–3)
- **Activities**:
  - Deploy **[dense sensor net kit](components/kits/dense-sensor-net-kit.md)** + ground radar for mapping soil, contaminants, topography.
  - Apply **[biochar & soil amendment kit](components/kits/biochar-soil-amendment-kit.md)** + **[microbial inoculant production kit](components/kits/microbial-inoculant-production-kit.md)** for initial bioremediation.
  - Install temporary **[foundation/base tiles](components/tiles/foundation-base-tile.md)** and **[permeable road/path tiles](components/tiles/permeable-road-path-tile.md)** for access.
  - Set up **[energy storage starter kit](components/kits/energy-storage-starter-kit.md)** + **[roof glazing BIPV tiles](components/tiles/roof-glazing-semi-transparent-bipv.md)** for power.
- **Milestone**: Site remediated to safe/agricultural levels; basic power/water online.
- **Cost**: $50k–$200k (kits + remediation).
- **Revenue**: Minimal (early carbon credits possible).

### Phase 2: Bootstrap Infrastructure & First Production (Months 4–9)
- **Activities**:
  - Build core structures: **[food desert housing starter kit](components/kits/food-desert-housing-starter-kit.md)** (ceramic housing modules), **[smart airlock kits](components/kits/smart-airlock-kit.md)** at entrances.
  - Deploy **[aquaponics pods](components/pods/aquaponics-pod.md)** and **[vertical ag expansion kits](components/kits/vertical-ag-expansion-kit.md)** for initial greens/protein.
  - Install **[biogas digester pods](components/pods/biogas-digester-pod.md)** + **[microbial inoculant pod](components/pods/microbial-inoculant-pod.md)** for nutrient cycling.
  - Add **[small animal pods](components/pods/livestock-pod.md)** (poultry/goats/rabbits) if space allows.
  - Connect to **[dense sensor net kit](components/kits/dense-sensor-net-kit.md)** and **[RTK GNSS anchor tiles](components/tiles/rtk-gnss-anchor-tile.md)** for precision ag.
- **Milestone**: Cash-positive (Month 6–9); first produce/eggs/milk sold locally or to nearby hub.
- **Cost**: $200k–$600k (pods + kits).
- **Revenue**: $10k–$50k/month (greens, eggs, early credits).

### Phase 3: Expansion & Maturity (Months 10–24)
- **Activities**:
  - Scale production: Add **[large animal pods](components/pods/large-animal-pod.md)** (cattle/sheep/goats/pigs), **[silvopasture canopy pods](components/pods/silvopasture-canopy-pod.md)**, and **[food processing pods](components/pods/food-processing-pod.md)**.
  - Build community amenities: **[smart display walls](components/tiles/smart-display-walls.md)**, **[TerraWell FreeCare](innovation-hub/terrawell-freecare-llc.md)** dispensers, retail plaza.
  - Integrate **[high-speed rail extensions](components/kits/hsr-rail-extension-kit.md)** or robotaxi links via **[Autonomous Mobility LLC](innovation-hub/autonomous-mobility-llc.md)**.
  - Achieve 95%+ closure (energy, water, nutrients).
- **Milestone**: Full maturity — self-sufficient, exporting surplus, generating $100k–$500k/month net.
- **Cost**: $500k–$1.5M (expansion kits/pods).
- **Revenue**: $100k–$500k/month (produce, meat/dairy, credits, retail).

## Recomputed Financials (per Mini-Hub, Mature)

- **Total CAPEX**: $0.8–$2.5M (phased over 18–24 months).
- **Break-Even**: Month 6–12 (cash-positive Month 6–9 in aggressive case).
- **Annual Revenue (mature)**: $1.2–$6M (produce/protein 60%, credits 20%, retail/services 20%).
- **IRR**: 40–60% (high due to low labor + revenue stacking).
- **Viability Impact**: +15–25% for food-desert rollout (local jobs + fresh food reduce resistance).

## Key Milestones Summary Table

| Month | Milestone | Key Deliverables | Cumulative Cost | Monthly Revenue |
|-------|-----------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 0     | Site approved | Survey + grants filed | $10k–$50k | $0 |
| 3     | Remediation complete | Sensors deployed, power/water online | $50k–$200k | $0–$5k |
| 9     | Bootstrap production | First greens/eggs/milk sold | $200k–$600k | $10k–$50k |
| 18–24 | Full maturity | 95%+ closure, surplus export | $0.8–$2.5M | $100k–$500k |

**Bottom Line**: Mini-hubs are the fastest path to exponential scaling — they are affordable, replicable, and community-owned. Adding livestock/poultry + processing pods in food deserts creates a complete local food system with jobs, nutrition, and revenue — one of the strongest humanitarian/political wins in the entire Genesis Network.
