# Sequestration Credit Platform  
**Genesis Network – Blockchain-Integrated Carbon & Biodiversity Credits**  
**Version 1.0 – January 21, 2026**

## 1. Overview & Purpose

The **Sequestration Credit Platform** is the Genesis Network’s in-house (or partnered) system for generating, verifying, issuing, and monetizing high-integrity **carbon credits**, **biodiversity credits**, **water recharge credits**, and **nutrient cycling credits**. It leverages the Network’s dense sensor array, **data moat**, **digital twins**, and automated reporting to produce verifiable, auditable credits that command premium pricing ($150–250/tCO₂e equivalent for carbon; higher for biodiversity/water).

**Primary objectives**:
- Monetize early sequestration (biochar, agroforestry, blue-green carbon, DAC pilots) to accelerate self-funding  
- Provide direct revenue to smallholders/affiliates for regenerative practices  
- Create transparent, blockchain-anchored proof-of-impact for corporate buyers, governments, and impact funds  
- Feed real-time data back into hub optimization and **NASA/ISS feedback loops** for space-grade carbon management  

## 2. Core Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Data Sources & Verification Engine

Every credit is backed by redundant, tamper-resistant data:

- **Hyper-dense sensors** (3–5× redundancy): soil carbon probes, flux towers, multispectral imaging, microbial activity sensors, water flow meters  
- **Digital twins** of each hub: simulate sequestration under different practices → validate field measurements  
- **Short-cycle ground truth**: weekly BSFL/microalgae harvests, monthly prawn/fish sampling, quarterly soil coring  
- **Satellite & drone corroboration**: external multispectral + LiDAR validation (optional third-party layer)  
- **Blockchain anchoring**: Merkle-rooted hashes of time-series data stored on-chain (e.g., Regen Network, Toucan, or custom chain)  

### 2.2 Credit Types & Methodologies

| Credit Type              | Methodology Basis                          | Verification Frequency | Projected Price Range (2030+) | Est. Annual Generation (Mature Hub) |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Soil Carbon**          | VM0042 (biochar), Verra ARR, RothC modeling | Quarterly soil sampling + continuous sensors | $150–250/tCO₂e                | 3–10 MtCO₂e                         |
| **Agroforestry / Silvopasture** | Verra ARR, Plan Vivo, IPCC Tier 2/3       | Annual remote sensing + ground plots | $120–220/tCO₂e                | 2–8 MtCO₂e                          |
| **Blue-Green Carbon**    | Verra VM0033 (mangroves), Tidal Wetland protocols | Biannual biomass + sediment cores | $200–400/tCO₂e                | 1–5 MtCO₂e                          |
| **DAC & Mineralization** | Puro.earth / Carbonfuture DAC protocols    | Continuous CO₂ capture logs + mineralization assays | $250–500/tCO₂e                | 0.5–3 MtCO₂e                        |
| **Biodiversity**         | Wallacea, Plan Vivo biodiversity modules   | Annual biodiversity surveys + camera traps | $50–150/ha/year               | $1–5M/hub                           |
| **Water Recharge**       | Emerging recharge protocols (e.g., CATIE)  | Continuous flow meters + aquifer modeling | $0.10–0.50/m³                 | $2–10M/hub                          |

All methodologies are selected or adapted to be **double-counting proof** and aligned with emerging ICVCM Core Carbon Principles.

### 2.3 Issuance & Retirement Workflow

1. **Data Collection** → automated sensor ingestion + manual validation  
2. **Processing & Modeling** → **digital twin** runs baseline vs. intervention scenarios  
3. **Third-Party Audit** → periodic desktop + field audits by Verra/Puro/Plan Vivo-approved validators  
4. **Tokenization** → credits minted as NFTs or fungible tokens on blockchain (e.g., Polygon, Celo)  
5. **Marketplace** → listed on Toucan, KlimaDAO, or custom Genesis marketplace  
6. **Retirement & Claims** → buyers retire tokens; Genesis issues public retirement certificates  

## 3. Revenue & Financial Model

**Per Mature Hub (5,000 ha, 2035+)**

| Credit Stream            | Annual Volume                  | Price Range       | Gross Revenue ($M/year) | Net After Costs & Sharing |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Soil Carbon + Biochar    | 5–15 MtCO₂e                    | $150–250          | 750–3,750                | 500–2,500                 |

| Water Recharge           | 10–50M m³                      | $0.10–0.50/m³     | 1–25                     | 0.8–20                    |
| **Total per Hub**        | —                              | —                 | **1,316–9,035**          | **891–6,120**             |

**Network-Wide (2035: 300–500 hubs)**: **$267B–$3T/year gross** (conservative: $300–1,000B realistic)  
**Cost Structure**: 25–35% (audits, blockchain fees, validator payments, smallholder share 10–20%)  
**Net to Network**: **$200–700B/year** (uplift to overall revenue model)

## 4. Smallholder & Affiliate Revenue Sharing

- **Base share**: 10–20% of credit revenue from land they manage  
- **Performance bonus**: +5–10% for verified yield/sequestration outperformance  
- **Payout mechanism**: Direct wallet transfers (stablecoins) or revenue-share offsets on kit purchases  
- **Impact**: Accelerates affiliate adoption; creates aligned incentives for global expansion

## 5. Compliance & Standards Alignment

- Verra (VM0000 series), Puro.earth, Plan Vivo, ICVCM Core Carbon Principles  
- Blockchain transparency: on-chain provenance + public dashboards  
- Third-party audits: annual field + desktop by approved validators  
- Double-counting prevention: jurisdictional nesting + buffer pools  

## 6. Implementation Timeline

- **2027–2029**: Pilot on 5–20 hubs; Verra/Plan Vivo registration; basic blockchain anchoring  
- **2030–2035**: Full automation + third-party validation; marketplace launch  
- **2035+**: Network-wide issuance; smallholder revenue sharing scaled globally
