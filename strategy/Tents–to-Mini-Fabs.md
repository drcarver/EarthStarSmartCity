## Overview & Context

The transition from leased industrial tents to pod-based mini-fabs is a critical step in the Genesis Network bootstrap, enabling sovereign production of sensors, edge AI, robotics, and compute tiles. Tents provide low-cost, rapid startup (Months 1–6) for initial R&D/testing/assembly using off-the-shelf parts, generating early cash to fund pod delivery. Pods (Months 7–12) shift to modular, resilient, lights-out capable mini-fabs (65–130 nm mature nodes), reducing costs 30–50% and boosting yields via data moat. This phase focuses on cash velocity, minimizing bottlenecks, and integrating viability enhancements (e.g., dense sensor nets for monitoring).

## Timeline & Phased Transition (Months 1–12)

### Months 1–3: Tent Setup & Initial R&D/Assembly (Pre-Mini-Fab Ramp)
- **Tent Configuration**  
  - Lease heavy-duty tent (10,000–20,000 sq ft, $5k–$15k/month) on orchard site—weatherproof, power/water hookups.  
  - Zones: Assembly (40%), R&D/testing (30%), storage (30%).  
  - Power: Generator (10–20 kW, $2k–$5k/month) + early solar kits (5–10 kW, $10k–$20k).  
  - Cooling: Fans + basic AWG ($5k–$10k).  
- **R&D/Testing**  
  - Assemble sensors/edge nodes from off-the-shelf (Raspberry Pi/Arduino, $20–$50/unit): Soil/moisture/temp ($10–$20), vibration ($5–$15), methane ($20–$50).  
  - Test lab: Multimeters/oscilloscopes ($2k–$5k); field-test on orchard (yield/biogas monitoring).  
  - Iteration: Basic AI (Python) analyzes data for +10–20% early optimizations.  
- **Actions**  
  - Hire 3–5 (engineer, technicians); secure inputs (chips/sensors from dual-sources).  
  - Produce 50–200 sensor units/month; integrate into pre-pod ops.  
- **Financials**  
  - CAPEX: $80k–$200k (tent/equipment).  
  - OPEX: $30k–$70k/month.  
  - Revenue: $10k–$50k/month (early sensor sales/compliance data).  
  - Net: –$20k to +$20k/month (offset by pre-pod cash).  

### Months 4–6: Tent Ramp-Up & Pod Prep (Bridge Phase)
- **Tent Operations**  
  - Scale assembly: 200–500 units/month; add edge compute (RISC-V boards, $50–$100/unit).  
  - Network: Ethernet/WiFi switches ($500–$1k); basic servers ($5k–$15k) for twins.  
- **R&D/Testing**  
  - Design compute tile prototypes: Embed chips in ceramic samples (off-the-shelf + basic molding).  
  - Testing: Lab/field for power (BIPV/piezo), compute (latency), durability (impact/weather sim).  
  - Data Moat Start: Sensors on equipment track yields; AI reduces waste 20–30%.  
- **Actions**  
  - Order first pods (mini-fab pods, $100k–$300k); secure advanced inputs (65 nm chips).  
  - Pilot dense sensor net: Radar/Starlink for mapping/internet ($20k–$50k).  
- **Financials**  
  - CAPEX Addition: $100k–$250k (upgrades).  
  - OPEX: $50k–$100k/month.  
  - Revenue: $50k–$200k/month (sensors/edge sales + data).  
  - Net: +$0–$100k/month (positive by Month 5–6).  

### Months 7–9: Pod Arrival & Mini-Fab Online (Transition Core)
- **Pod Configuration**  
  - 5–10 mini-fab pods arrive (modified 40 ft containers, ceramic shells phased in).  
  - Setup: Retrofit tent with pods; zones for lithography (DUV, $50–$100M royalties), cleanrooms (ISO 7–8, $10–$20M).  
  - Power/Water: Biogas + BIPV + AWG ($20k–$50k).  
- **R&D/Testing**  
  - Produce first compute tiles: Embed RISC-V/sensors in ceramic (yields 50–70% start).  
  - Testing: Full validation (formal proofs for OS, field for durability); iterate via data moat (+20–60% yields).  
  - Bottleneck Reduction: Dual-source chips; sensor net monitors production real-time.  
- **Actions**  
  - Migrate assembly to pods; scale to 10k–50k units/month.  
  - Transition twins: From central servers to distributed tile clusters.  
- **Financials**  
  - CAPEX Addition: $200k–$500k (pods/setup).  
  - OPEX: $80k–$150k/month.  
  - Revenue: $100k–$400k/month (compute tiles/sensors).  
  - Net: +$20k–$250k/month.  

### Months 10–12: Full Mini-Fab Maturity & Bootstrap Acceleration
- **Operations**  
  - Lights-out ramp: 70–85% automation (robotic handling).  
  - Scale: 50k–200k units/month; produce advanced nodes (28 nm target).  
- **R&D/Testing**  
  - Optimize for 7 nm pilots; full data moat (AI federated learning).  
  - Off-World Prep: Test radiation-hardened variants.  
- **Actions**  
  - Expand to multiple hubs; integrate with OceanNet/off-world plans.  
  - Bottleneck Fixes: LLC distribution spreads oversight; sensor nets reduce downtime 20–40%.  
- **Financials**  
  - CAPEX Addition: $150k–$300k (upgrades).  
  - OPEX: $100k–$200k/month.

  - Net: +$100k–$600k/month; enables exponential growth.  

## Overall Financials (Months 1–12, Conservative/Base/Aggressive)

- **Cumulative CAPEX**: $530k–$1.25M / $430k–$1M / $330k–$800k  
- **Cumulative Revenue**: $360k–$1.45M / $660k–$2.5M / $960k–$3.8M  
- **Cumulative Net Cash**: –$170k to +$200k / +$230k to +$1.5M / +$630k to +$3M  
- **Break-Even**: Month 5–7 (base); funds full scale-up.  
- **Viability Uplift**: Sensor nets/LLC distribution +15–25% (reduced bottlenecks, spread risk/burnout).  

This tent-to-mini-fab transition is low-risk (off-the-shelf start), viable (+ cash by Month 6), and enhances overall project by enabling sovereign compute early.
