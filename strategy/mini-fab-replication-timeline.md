## Context & Assumptions

The **first mini-fab** (65–130 nm mature-node, pod-based) becomes fully operational in **Months 7–12** of bootstrap (tent → pod transition).  
It is located in a retrofitted tent or first permanent ceramic cluster on the initial distressed orchard site.  

Replication refers to building additional mini-fab clusters (each 5–20 pods) to produce sensors, edge AI, robotics, and compute tiles at scale.  

**Key Assumptions**  
- First mini-fab output: 10k–100k units/year (sensors/AI chips) initially, scaling to 50k–200k/year within 6–12 months via data moat optimization.  
- All components (ceramic shells, electronics, assembly) produced in-house or dual-sourced.  
- Self-funding: Revenue from first mini-fab (chip sales, data services) funds replication.  
- Bottleneck reduction: Dense sensor net + LLC distribution + pre-supply staging.  

## Replication Process & Timeline

Once the first mini-fab is stable (yields ≥70–80%, positive cash flow, data moat active), replication follows a phased, exponential pattern.

### Phase 1: Proof & Ramp-Up (Months 13–18 after bootstrap start)
- **Duration**: 6 months  
- **Output Goal**: First mini-fab reaches 50k–100k units/year; produce components for 2–5 additional mini-fabs.  
- **Actions**  
  - Optimize first mini-fab (AI-driven yield +20–60%).  
  - Produce ceramic shells, RISC-V boards, sensor embeds for new pods.  
  - Build/test 2–3 additional mini-fab pods in parallel (using first mini-fab output).  
  - Deploy dense sensor net on new sites for real-time monitoring.  
- **Resource Requirements**  
  - CAPEX: $0.5–$1.5M per additional pod cluster (funded by first mini-fab revenue).  
  - Labor: 10–20 per new cluster (shared across LLCs).  
  - Inputs: C&D slag/RHA (tipping contracts), chips (dual-source).  
- **Timeline**: 1–2 new mini-fab clusters online by Month 18.  

### Phase 2: Exponential Replication (Months 19–36)
- **Duration**: 18 months  
- **Output Goal**: 5–20 mini-fabs operational; total capacity 0.5–2M units/year.  
- **Actions**  
  - First mini-fabs produce full pods for new sites (5–10 pods/cluster).  
  - Use revenue-share from affiliates to subsidize rollout.  
  - Integrate compute tiles into all new hubs (distributed twins).  
  - Sensor nets + data moat accelerate yields across network.  
- **Resource Requirements**  
  - CAPEX: $2–$10M per 5-pod cluster (self-funded).  
  - Time per cluster: 3–6 months (pod production + setup).  
  - Bottleneck Fix: Pre-supply staging + LLC parallel execution.  
- **Timeline**: 5–10 new mini-fabs online by Month 24; 15–20 by Month 36.  

### Phase 3: Network-Wide Scaling (Months 37+)
- **Duration**: Ongoing  
- **Output Goal**: 50–200+ mini-fabs; capacity 5M–20M+ units/year.  
- **Actions**  
  - Mini-fabs self-replicate (produce pods for new mini-fabs).  
  - Advanced nodes (7 nm → 3 nm) pilots begin when yields >80%.  
  - Global licensing: Export kits + blueprints to aligned regions.  
- **Resource Requirements**  
  - CAPEX: $50–$200M/year (network-wide, self-funded).  
  - Growth Rate: Doubles every 12–18 months (exponential flywheel).  
- **Timeline**: 50+ mini-fabs by 2032–2033; 100+ by 2035.  

## Recomputed Financials for Replication (Network-Wide, Conservative/Base/Aggressive)

| Year (from bootstrap start) | Mini-Fabs Operational | CAPEX Addition ($M) | Revenue from Mini-Fabs ($M/year) | Net Cash Flow from Mini-Fabs ($M/year) | Notes |

| Year 6–10 (2032–2036)       | 50–200+               | 50–200/year         | 500–2,000 / 1,000–4,000 / 2,000–8,000 | +300–1,500 / +600–3,000 / +1,200–6,000 | Mature network |

## Viability & Bottleneck Reduction Notes

- **Replication Speed**: 3–6 months per new cluster once first mini-fab is stable; exponential growth enabled by self-production.  
- **Bottlenecks Mitigated**: Pre-supply staging + dual-sourcing + LLC distribution + sensor nets (real-time monitoring).  
- **Viability Uplift**: +15–25% (sovereign compute early, risk spread, cash flow acceleration).  

This transition turns the first mini-fab into a self-replicating engine, funding and building the network at exponential speed.
