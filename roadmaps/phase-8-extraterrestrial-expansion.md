# Extraterrestrial Phase 8 Expansion

**Phase 8** marks the transition of the **Genesis Network** from Earth-surface dominance to a multi-planetary and eventually interstellar regenerative civilization. All systems remain 100% self-replicating, closed-loop, waste-derived (where possible), and lights-out automated. The architecture leverages proven terrestrial pods, tiles, kits, and replication techniques, hardened for vacuum, radiation, low gravity, and extreme thermal cycling.

This phase begins after mature terrestrial saturation (~2060–2075) and builds on **lunar industrial footholds** established in the 2050s.

## Strategic Objectives

1. Establish self-sustaining industrial capacity on **Luna** for material export and construction feedstock.
2. Seed and scale regenerative surface hubs on **Mars** for food, water, oxygen, and propellant production.
3. Deploy robotic asteroid mining outposts to supply volatiles and metals.
4. Construct kilometer-scale rotating **O'Neill cylinders** as long-term habitats (post-2100).
5. Launch self-replicating **von Neumann probes** for interstellar exploration and seeding (post-2150 speculative).

All expansion is funded from terrestrial cash flows (no external capital). **PlaceNet** sensor nets and digital twins provide the intelligence foundation for site selection, resource mapping, risk modeling, and replication optimization.
