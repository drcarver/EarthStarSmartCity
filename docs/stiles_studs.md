# Enhanced Ceramic Tiles and Smart Studs

Enhanced Ceramic Tiles and Smart Studs are the backbone of the Earth-Star Sustainable Smart City, enabling rapid, resilient, and sustainable construction that surpasses conventional methods like concrete and steel. These modular components integrate advanced materials (silicon carbide, graphene, zirconia) with embedded technologies (photovoltaics, batteries, water generators) to create energy-positive, zero-waste buildings. Used across all project structures—single-family homes, farm towers, hospitals, and more—they support the goal of housing 333 million US residents by 2040 while advancing AI leadership through semiconductor production and scalable infrastructure.
