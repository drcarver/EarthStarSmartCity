# Earth-Star Industries Facility Project

The Earth-Star Industries Facility is a visionary, self-sufficient high-rise building that embodies sustainable abundance through the integration of AI, robotics, and closed-loop systems. This project scales to support a hub-and-spoke urban district for 20,000 residents across five towers, leveraging modular construction and advanced technologies feasible in 2025. The core design centers on a 150-meter-tall, 15-floor cylindrical building with approximately 265,000 m² total floor area and a height-to-diameter ratio of ~1 for structural stability (150 m diameter). Note: Material quantities and costs have been recomputed for accuracy based on the 5 m² coverage
