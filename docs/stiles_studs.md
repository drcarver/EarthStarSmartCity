# Earth-Star Industries Facility Project

The Earth-Star Industries Facility is a visionary, self-sufficient, 150-meter-tall, 15-floor cylindrical high-rise (~265,000 m², height-to-diameter ratio ~1) designed for sustainable abundance through advanced AI, robotics, and closed-loop systems. Located in an existing urban district, it serves as a hub in a hub-and-spoke model supporting 20,000 people, integrating luxurious residential spaces, vertical farming, waste recycling, cleanroom manufacturing, and energy production. The facility is fully off-grid, complies with sustainable building codes, and leverages 2025 technologies to achieve Green Star 5 Star, Fitwel 3 Star, WELL Silver, LEED Gold, BREEAM Excellent, UN SDGs (3, 6, 7, 11, 12), ISO standards (14644-1, 52120-1, 27001, 37122), NATO standards (STANAG 4370, 7159, 2582), military standards (UFC 4-010-01, 3-340-02, 3-410-01, 3-401-01, MIL-STD-810H, 461G, 188-125-1, 1474E, NIST 800-53), and building standards (ASHRAE 90.1, 62.1, ICC 500, NFPA 101).
