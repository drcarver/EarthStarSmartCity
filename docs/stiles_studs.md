# Earth-Star Industries Facility Project

The Earth-Star Industries Facility is a visionary, self-sufficient, 150-meter-tall, 15-floor cylindrical high-rise (~265,000 m², height-to-diameter ratio ~1) designed for sustainable abundance through AI, robotics, and closed-loop systems. Located within an existing city as a hub in a hub-and-spoke urban model supporting 20,000 people, it integrates luxurious residential spaces, advanced manufacturing, vertical farming, waste recycling, and renewable energy. The facility achieves Green Star 5 Star, Fitwel 3 Star, WELL Silver, LEED Gold, BREEAM Excellent, and complies with UN SDGs (3, 6, 7, 11, 12), NASA CELSS, ISO (14644-1, 52120-1, 27001, 37122), NATO (STANAG 4370, 7159, 2582), military (UFC 4-010-01, 3-340-02, 3-410-01, 3-401-01, MIL-STD-810H, 461G, 188-125-1, 1474E, NIST 800-53), and building standards (ASHRAE 90.1, 62.1, ICC 500, NFPA 101). It operates off-grid, financed through sales and grants, and reuses existing infrastructure to prevent urban hollowing.
