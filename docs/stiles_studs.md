# Earth-Star Industries Facility Project

The Earth-Star Industries Facility is a visionary, self-sufficient high-rise building embodying sustainable abundance through AI, robotics, and closed-loop systems. This comprehensive description details the project for a hub-and-spoke urban district supporting 20,000 residents via 5 interconnected towers. All volumes, costs, and revenues have been recomputed to scale proportionally from the single-tower baseline, using 2025 technologies for feasibility. Scaling assumes linear proportionality for simplicity, with adjustments for efficiencies in multi-tower operations (e.g., shared infrastructure reducing per-tower CapEx by 25% for additional units).

## Project Overview
The facility comprises 5 cylindrical towers, each 150-meter-tall with 15 floors (~265,000 m² total area per tower, height-to-diameter ratio ~1 for stability, 150 m diameter), yielding ~1,325,000 m² district-wide.
