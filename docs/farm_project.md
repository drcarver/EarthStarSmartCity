# Earth-Star Sustainable Farm

The Earth-Star Sustainable Farm is a 17-floor, 17.7 ha (300,333 m²) vertical high-rise producing 36,800 tons/year of grocery products (31,500 tons food, 1,100 tons non-food, 8,315 tons byproducts, 1M L beverages), feeding 94,340 people. Built with 393,618 Enhanced Ceramic Tiles and 25,000 Smart Studs, it processes 760–1,510 tons/day waste (90% recovery) and generates 372.915 MW renewable energy, aligning with UN SDGs (3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13) and standards like LEED Gold and ISO 14001.

## Farm Specifications
- **Outputs**:
  - Food (31,500 tons): 17,750 tons crops (greens, tomatoes, grains), 3,450 tons fish/shellfish, 4,400 tons meat/eggs, 2,200 tons dairy, 1,600 tons baked goods, 2,150 tons beverages/condiments, 500 tons meals.
  - Non-Food (1,100 tons): Wool, leather, hemp, PHA/PBS, mycelium.
  - Byproducts (8,315 tons): Manure, crop residue for tile/semiconductor feedstock.
  - Beverages: 1M L (beer, wine, spirits, mixers).
- **Systems**:
  - Organic Techniques: No-till, cover crops, biochar, compost, vermicast, agroforestry.
  - Water: 1,411,318 L/day, 90% recycled (AWG, greywater).
  - Energy: 372.915 MW (193.78 MW solar/GSHP, 202.55 MW biogas, 11 MW roads).
  - Waste: 760–1,510 tons/day (90% recovery for tiles, semiconductors).
- **Automation**: 95% (573 drones, 216 robots, 121 planters, 33 digesters).

## Construction and Costs
- **CapEx**: $163M (tiles: $3.936M, studs: $1.125M, kits: $158.039M).
- **OpEx**: $50.49M/year.
- **Revenue**: $686–$773M/year (food, non-food, byproducts, energy, carbon credits).
- **ROI**: 600–650%, breakeven Month 8.

## Role in Earth-Star Project
- **Food Security**: Feeds 94,340/city, scalable to 333M.
- **AI Leadership**: Supplies semiconductors (1 ton/day) for data centers.
- **Sustainability**: Sequesters 63,561–123,163 tons/year CO₂e.
