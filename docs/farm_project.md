# Earth-Star Industries Skyscraper Farm

TheUsin The Earth-Star Industries Skyscraper Farm is a 15-floor, large-scale agricultural facility with a 5-acre footprint (~300,000 m²) designed to produce organic farm-derived products (seafood, crops, meat, eggs, milk, processed goods) to feed a 20,000-person urban district. Constructed entirely from Enhanced Ceramic Tiles and Smart Studs sourced from the Earth-Star Industries tile factory, it integrates with smart roads and sidewalks, supplying feedstock for ceramics and semiconductors. The farm adheres to USDA Organic, ASC, GAP Step 4, IFANCA (halal), OU (kosher), and BPI standards, prioritizing livestock welfare and cultural/religious diversity (halal, kosher, vegan). It features 90–95% water recycling, comprehensive waste processing, and renewable energy, financed by tile factory revenues and grants, operating off-grid by recycling existing infrastructure. All equipment, including cleanroom, ceramics production, and recycling lines, is constructed from ceramic-based modular kits.
