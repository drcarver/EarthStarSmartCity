# Earth-Star Industries Skyscraper Farm

The Earth-Star Industries Skyscraper Farm is a 15-floor, large-scale (5-acre footprint, ~300,000 m²) agricultural facility designed to produce organic farm-derived products (seafood, crops, meat, eggs, milk, processed goods) to feed a 20,000-person urban district. Built using Enhanced Ceramic Tiles and Smart Studs from the Earth-Star Industries Facility, it connects via smart roads and sidewalks, supplying feedstock for ceramics and semiconductors. The farm adheres to USDA Organic, ASC, GAP Step 4, halal (IFANCA), kosher (OU), and BPI standards, prioritizing livestock welfare and cultural/religious diversity (halal, kosher, vegan). It integrates 90–95% water recycling, comprehensive waste processing, and renewable energy, financed by tile factory revenues and grants, and operates off-grid by recycling existing infrastructure.
