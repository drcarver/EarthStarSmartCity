# MyPlate-Compliant Food Production  
**Genesis Network Standard**

The **Genesis Network** is explicitly designed to produce food that fully meets **[MyPlate](https://www.myplate.gov/)** guidelines from the USDA — the current U.S. dietary standard emphasizing balanced nutrition across five food groups: Fruits, Vegetables, Grains, Protein Foods, and Dairy (or fortified alternatives). All outputs from **[enhanced aquaponics pods](../components/pods-catalog.md)**, **livestock pods**, **staples pods**, **orchard pods**, and **processing pods** are aligned with **MyPlate** proportions and nutritional targets.

## MyPlate Food Group Coverage in Genesis

| MyPlate Group       | Genesis Sources                                      | Key Outputs                                      | Nutritional Alignment & Notes                     |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Fruits**          | **[Orchard pods](../components/pods-catalog.md)** (dwarf trees), vertical berries, greenhouse fruits | Apples, citrus, figs, pomegranates, peaches, berries | Fresh & processed (jams/confectionary); 1–2 cups/day target |
| **Vegetables**      | **[Aquaponics pods](../components/pods-catalog.md)** (greens/herbs), staples trays, rooftop/balcony systems | Leafy greens, microgreens, herbs, root vegetables | 2–3 cups/day; diverse colors for micronutrients |
| **Grains**          | **Staples pods** (rice, wheat, potatoes in flooded trays), bakery processing | Whole grains, rice, potato-based products        | At least half whole grains; 6–8 oz/day target     |
| **Protein Foods**   | **[Livestock pods](../components/pods-catalog.md)** (milk, meat, eggs), **aquaponics** (fish/prawns/crayfish/mussels), insects (BSFL), legumes | Fish, poultry, beef, goat/dairy, eggs, legumes, insects | Lean & varied; 5–6.5 oz/day target                |
| **Dairy**           | **Dairy pods** (cow/goat milk), processing (cheese/yogurt), fortified plant alternatives | Milk, cheese, yogurt                             | 3 cups/day; low-fat options emphasized            |

## Integration & Compliance Mechanisms

- **Staggered Cycles**: All biological pods use overlapping production phases → continuous, year-round availability of each group.  
- **Nutritional Optimization**: **[Microbial inoculants](../components/kits-catalog.md)** and **[data moat](../docs/viability-enhancements.md)** refine nutrient density (e.g., higher omega-3 in fish via feed).  
- **Processing Pods**: Bakery, dairy, butcher, confectionary ensure MyPlate-friendly formats (whole-grain bread, low-sugar jams, lean cuts).  
- **TerraWell FreeCare**: Meals distributed via **[TerraWell FreeCare](../docs/terrawell-freecare.md)** meet MyPlate exactly — tracked for compliance audits.  
- **Monitoring**: **[Hyper-dense sensors](../docs/sensor-handbook.md)** (multispectral, VOC) verify quality; blockchain logs for traceability.  

## Sensor Table for MyPlate Compliance Monitoring

| Sensor Type                        | Application in Food Production | Specs                                      | Standards Compliance                  | Cost ($/unit) |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------|
| **Multispectral Imaging**          | Nutrient density & ripeness    | 5–20 bands, chlorophyll detection          | **[OGC SWE](../docs/standards/ogc-swe.md)** | 25–50        |
| **VOC & Pathogen Detection**       | Food safety & spoilage         | 1–10 ppm sensitivity                       | **[NASA-STD-3001](../docs/standards/nasa-std-3001.md)** | 20–40        |
| **Soil/Water Nutrient Sensors**    | Crop quality control           | ±0.1 pH, nitrate/phosphate ppm             | **[IEEE 1451](../docs/standards/ieee-1451.md)** | 10–20        |
| **Thermal/Humidity**               | Storage & processing conditions| ±0.5°C, ±3% RH                             | **[MIL-STD-810](../docs/standards/mil-std-810.md)** | 8–15         |
| **Flow & Weight**                  | Portion control & yield tracking | 0.1 g accuracy                            | **[ISO/TC 268](../docs/standards/iso-tc-268.md)** | 12–25        |

All food production complies with **MyPlate** guidelines, ensuring balanced, nutrient-dense outputs across the network.
