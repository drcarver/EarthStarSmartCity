# Genesis Network – BVOC & Microbial Sensors Specification Sheet

## Executive Overview

BVOC & Microbial Sensors are specialized, embedded devices in the Genesis Network designed to monitor biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted by plants and microbes, as well as microbial activity in soil, air, and water. These sensors enable real-time detection of plant stress, soil health, pathogen presence, and air quality, facilitating ruthless data-driven optimization of agriculture, biorefineries, and environmental restoration. Deployed via dense redundant arrays (3–5×), they integrate with digital twins for predictive analytics, enhancing yields by 10–25% and sequestration via microbial boosts. Manufactured in-house, they support compliance with ISO 14001 and smart city standards, with a project phase rollout starting in early scale (2029–2035).

## Viability & Integration Notes

BVOC & Microbial Sensors integrate seamlessly into tiles/pods/kits, leveraging the data moat for 10–25% yield/sequestration gains via microbial optimization. Manufactured in Tile Production Pods, they enhance compliance (ISO 14001) and generate $10–40M/hub/year in indirect revenue (credits, premium yields). Rollout in early scale (2029–2035) aligns with microbial inoculant scale-up, boosting overall viability by +5–15% through precision ag and environmental monitoring.
