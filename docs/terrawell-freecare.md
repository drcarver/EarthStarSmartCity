# TerraWell FreeCare  
**Humanitarian Layer of the Genesis Network**  
**Independent 501(c)(3) Nonprofit – TerraWell Foundation**  
**Last Updated: January 21, 2026**

## Mission & Core Principles

**TerraWell FreeCare** is the fully independent humanitarian arm of the Genesis Network, operating as a separate **501(c)(3)** public charity under U.S. tax law. It exists to provide **100% free** essential goods and services to the ill, needy, distressed, and disaster-affected populations—without co-pays, means testing, or identification requirements.

**Key Principles**:
- Strict legal and operational separation from **Earth-Star Industries** (for-profit entity) and all Genesis commercial/regenerative operations  
- Funded exclusively through fair-market-value donations of tangible surplus inventory (food, OTC medications, generics where compliant, 3D-printed **durable medical equipment**)  
- No donation of services, cash, "visit credits," or professional time to preserve tax-exempt status  
- All services delivered free at the point of use, emphasizing dignity and accessibility  
- Facilities built on remediated MSW-processing brownfield sites using standard **Genesis ceramic tiles** and kits (arm's-length FMV purchases only)  
- Smart airlocks with hyperspectral scanning for basic health triage and security in every center  

## Legal & Tax Structure

**TerraWell Foundation** is a standalone **501(c)(3)** public charity with:
- Independent board of directors (no overlap with Earth-Star)  
- Separate governance, finances, personnel, and facilities  
- Arm's-length transactions for all interactions with Genesis entities  
- Donations limited to qualifying tangible inventory under **IRC §170(e)(3)** (enhanced deductions for food and certain medical supplies used for care of the ill/needy)  
- No public funds accepted to maintain independence and avoid compliance burdens  
- Annual IRS Form 990 transparency filings and independent audits
