# Complete Inventory of **Tiles**, **Pods** & **Kits**

**Version**: Consolidated Master Inventory – January 2026  
**Core Manufacturing Rule**: All **tiles**, **pods**, **kits** and building components are produced exclusively within the **Tile & Pipe Production Pod** → permanent ceramic factories. All buildings and fixed infrastructure are constructed **only** from Genesis toughened ceramic **tiles**, ceramic modules and self-replicating flat-pack **kits**. No virgin concrete, steel, asphalt or non-recycled aggregates are permitted beyond minimal RCA bases where structurally unavoidable.

**Security & Standards Compliance**  
- **Smart Airlocks**: Mandatory at every building, pod cluster, housing module, school, hospital, and factory entrance. Dual-chamber design with mmWave radar + multispectral imaging + metal/explosive trace detection. Alerts route to local security AI → human response teams. Faraday mesh + EMP hardening standard.  
- **Smart City Standards**: Full alignment with ISO/TC 268 (sustainable cities), ISO 37120 (city indicators), IEEE 2030 (smart grid), ITU-T Y.4900 (smart sustainable cities), NIST cybersecurity framework.  
- **Sustainable Building Codes**: Cradle-to-Cradle certified materials, net-zero energy/water, 95–99% resource closure, passive-dominant design, LEED Platinum / Living Building Challenge equivalent targets.

## 1. All Tile Families – Master List

All **tiles** are manufactured in **Tile & Pipe Production Pods** → permanent ceramic factories.  
**Composition**: 70–95% waste-derived (C&D slag, rice husk ash silica, farm residues, ELFM slag, brownfield materials).  
**Manufacturing**: Extrusion / pressing → tunnel drying → 1,200–1,400°C firing (biogas/natural gas) → embedded feature integration (BIPV, piezo, AWG channels, sensors, bladders).  
**Universal Features**: Embedded Faraday mesh, conduits (power/water/data/pneumatic), 3–5× redundant sensors, self-healing surface coatings.
