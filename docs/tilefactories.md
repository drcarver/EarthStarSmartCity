# Earth-Star Industries Facility Project

This document outlines the recomputed Earth-Star Industries Facility Project, a 150-meter-tall, 15-floor cylindrical high-rise (265,000 m², 150 m diameter) designed for sustainability, resilience, and self-sufficiency. All equipment, including cleanroom and semiconductor manufacturing, ceramics production, and recycling lines, is made from in-house ceramic tiles, studs, and modular kits. Costs, revenues, and volumes are recalculated for a 20,000-person urban district with a hub-and-spoke model, incorporating smart city standards, security airlocks, and viability enhancements.
