## Introduction

The Earth-Star Industries Sustainable Urban Agriculture System Kit is a household-scale, closed-loop solution for 4–6 person U.S. urban households (e.g., Seattle, Miami). Housed in a 300–500 ft² sunroom, it integrates waste management, water recycling, energy generation, food production, and recreational features (in-ground pool, hot tub, sauna, outdoor kitchen). The system processes 3–4 kg/day of organic and non-organic waste (sewage, food scraps, MSW) and 50–100 liters/day of greywater, producing food, energy, water, and construction tiles while capturing CO₂. All components, including cleanroom equipment, ceramics production, and recycling lines, are built from enhanced ceramic tiles, smart studs, and modular kits sourced from Earth-Star Industries tile factories. The system aligns with green building codes (LEED Gold, ASHRAE 90.1, ICC 500) and smart city standards (ISO 37122).

Costs, revenues, and volumes are recomputed for 2025 technologies, reusing Tile, Stud, and Amenity Kits from the Earth-Star Industries Facility Project and introducing new kits (Sunroom Kit, Agriculture Kit, Waste Processing Kit). Viability enhancements (subsidies, automation, partnerships) are implemented to reduce costs and bottlenecks.
