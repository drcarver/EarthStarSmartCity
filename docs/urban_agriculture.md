# Sustainable Urban Agriculture System

The Sustainable Urban Agriculture System is a cornerstone of the Earth-Star Sustainable Smart City, integrated into each of the 5,000 single-family homes to provide food, water, energy, and waste management in a closed-loop, AI-driven ecosystem. Designed to support 20,000 residents per city (500 ha) and scalable to house 333 million US residents by 2040, this system leverages modular kits built from Enhanced Ceramic Tiles and Smart Studs, ensuring self-sufficiency and sustainability. It aligns with UN SDGs (3: Health, 6: Water, 7: Energy, 11: Cities, 12: Consumption, 13: Climate), Green Star 5 Star, LEED Gold, and smart city standards (ISO 37122, NIST 800-53), reducing household costs by $1,400–$3,303/year and supporting the US as an AI superpower through waste-derived resources.

## System Components

  - **Features**: LED lighting (PV-powered), hydroponics/aeroponics, AI climate control.
- **Algae Bioreactor Kit** ($2,000):
  - **Scale**: 100–200 L.
  - **Output**: 0.1–0.3 kg/day CO₂ sequestration, 0.5–1 kg/day biomass (nutrients, biofuel).
  - **Features**: Ceramic bioreactors, integrated with tile microchannels.
- **Tile Ceramic Production System (TCPS) Kit** ($3,000):
  - **Capacity**: Produces 0.1–0.2 kg/day proto-tiles from waste (plastics, inerts).
  - **Output**: Feedstock for tile factories, reducing external material needs.
  - **Features**: Ceramic compactor/press, AI-guided.
- **Waste-to-Energy (WTE) Kit** ($2,500):
  - **Capacity**: Incinerates 0.2–0.5 kg/day non-recyclable waste.
  - **Output**: 0.2–0.9 kWh/day electricity.
  - **Features**: Ceramic-lined incinerator, emissions scrubbed (odor control kit, $1,500).

## System Performance
- **Closed-Loop Efficiency**: 85–95% resource recovery (waste, water, nutrients, energy).
  - **Waste**: 2 kg/day processed, 90% diverted from landfills (1.8 kg to biogas, digestate, tiles).
  - **Water**: 65–145 L/day (15–45 L AWG, 50–100 L greywater), 90% recycled.
  - **Energy**: 0.3–1.15 kWh/day/home (biogas, WTE, tile PV), offsetting 100% household needs.
  - **Food**: 60–120 kg/year/home (10–20 kg fish, 50–100 kg crops), covering 30–50% of dietary needs.
  - **CO₂ Sequestration**: 0.1–0.3 kg/day/home via algae, contributing to 317,805–615,815 tons/year/city.
- **Cost Savings**: $1,400–$3,303/year/home:
  - Food: $1,000–$2,000 (60–120 kg at $16.67/kg).
  - Water: $100–$300 (65–145 L/day at $0.002/L).
