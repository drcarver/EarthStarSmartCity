# Sustainable Urban Agriculture System Kit for Earth-Star Industries

The Sustainable Urban Agriculture System is a household-scale, closed-loop solution designed for a U.S. urban household of 4–6 people (e.g., Seattle, Miami). Housed in a 300–500 ft² sunroom, it integrates waste management, water recycling, energy generation, and food production, leveraging Enhanced Ceramic Tiles and Smart Studs from the Earth-Star Industries Facility. The system processes sewage, organic and non-organic municipal solid waste (MSW), and greywater, producing food, energy, water, and construction tiles while capturing CO₂. Recreational features like an in-ground pool, hot tub, sauna, and outdoor kitchen enhance lifestyle value, making it a hybrid agricultural-recreational hub. The system uses solar, biogas, geothermal, and micro-hydro energy, with automation, odor control, and smart airlocks ensuring urban compatibility and compliance with smart city and sustainable building standards.

This kit-based system reuses Earth-Star’s Tile Kits, Stud Kits, and Farm Kits, supplemented by new kits tailored for household-scale components. All structures are built using Enhanced Ceramic Tiles and Smart Studs, ensuring modularity, resilience, and sustainability.
