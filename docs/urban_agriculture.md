## Introduction

The Earth-Star Industries Sustainable Urban Agriculture System Kit is a household-scale, closed-loop solution designed for a U.S. urban setting (e.g., Seattle or Miami), serving a household of 4–6 people. Housed in a 300–500 ft² (28–46 m²) sunroom, it integrates waste management, water recycling, energy generation, food production, and recreational features (in-ground pool, hot tub, sauna, outdoor kitchen). The system processes 3–4 kg/day of sewage, organic, and non-organic municipal solid waste (MSW), and greywater, producing food, energy, water, and construction tiles while capturing CO₂. All components are built from enhanced ceramic tiles, smart studs, and modular kits sourced from Earth-Star Industries tile factories, leveraging 2025 technologies (solar, biogas, geothermal) and aligning with green building codes (LEED Gold, ASHRAE 90.1, ICC 500, ISO 37122).

The kit reuses Tile, Stud, and Amenity Kits from the Earth-Star Industries Facility Project, introducing new Sunroom, Agriculture, and Waste Processing Kits. Costs, revenues, and volumes are recomputed, incorporating viability enhancements (subsidies, modular scalability, automation, partnerships) to reduce bottlenecks. Smart airlocks ensure security, and all systems comply with smart city and sustainable building standards.
