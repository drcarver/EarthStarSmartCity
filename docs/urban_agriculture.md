## Introduction

The Earth-Star Industries Sustainable Urban Agriculture System Kit is a household-scale, closed-loop solution for a U.S. urban household (4-6 people) in settings like Seattle or Miami. Housed in a 300-500 ft² (28-46 m²) sunroom, it integrates waste management, water recycling, energy generation, food production, and recreational features (in-ground pool, hot tub, sauna, outdoor kitchen). The system processes 3-4 kg/day of organic and non-organic waste (sewage, MSW, greywater), producing food, energy, water, and construction tiles while capturing CO₂. All components, including cleanroom equipment, ceramics production, and recycling lines, are built from enhanced ceramic tiles, smart studs, and modular kits sourced from Earth-Star Industries tile factories. The system aligns with green building codes (LEED Gold, ASHRAE 90.1, ICC 500) and smart city standards (ISO 37122).

This kit reuses Tile, Stud, and Amenity Kits from the Earth-Star Industries Facility Project, introducing new Sunroom, Agriculture, and Waste Processing Kits. Costs, revenues, and volumes are recomputed for 2025 technology, incorporating viability enhancements (subsidies, automation, modular scalability).
