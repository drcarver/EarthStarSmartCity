# Genesis Network: Full Catalog of Tiles, Pods, and Kits

**Comprehensive Catalog of All Tiles, Pods, and Kits**  
**Manufacturing, Inputs, Materials, Costs, and Revenues**  
**Date: January 21, 2026**

## Introduction

This document provides the complete catalog of all **tiles**, **pods**, and **kits** in the Genesis Network. All components are manufactured exclusively in **tile factory pods** using **70–95% waste-derived inputs** (C&D slag, rice husk ash silica, farm residues, ELFM/brownfield slag). Buildings and infrastructure are constructed solely from these tiles, ceramics, and kits, ensuring full circularity and compliance with **smart city standards** (ISO/TC 268, ITU-T Y.4900, IEEE 2030) and sustainable codes (ISO 14001, Cradle-to-Cradle).

**Smart airlocks** are standard in all buildings/pods, embedding mmWave/multispectral sensors for weapons/explosives detection and AI/security alerts. Costs recalculated with 20–25% reductions from automation/pre-supply; revenues uplifted 25–30% from premiums/credits. Viability enhancements: **microbial inoculants** (+10–30% yields), **blockchain credits** ($150–250/tCO₂e), **waste heat recovery**.

## 1. Tiles Catalog

All tiles are **toughened ceramic composites** with embedded features (BIPV, AWG, piezo, sensors, Faraday mesh, water bladders). Phased rollout protects cash flow.
