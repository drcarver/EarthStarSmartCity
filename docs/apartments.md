# Earth-Star Industries Luxery Living Complex

The Earth-Star Industries Luxeery Living Complex expands the original Earth-Star Industries Facility to include luxurious apartments for 150 residents (mixed singles and families), integrating sustainable urban agriculture, recreational amenities, office spaces, and in-house manufacturing of furniture, electronics, appliances, linens, and towels. This self-sufficient, high-rise complex (150 m tall, 150 m diameter, 15 floors, ~265,000 m²) is built entirely with Enhanced Ceramic Tiles and Smart Studs, leveraging existing Tile, Stud, Farm, and Sustainable Urban Agriculture System kits, plus new kits for apartments, furniture, electronics, appliances, and office spaces. The complex supports sustainable building codes (LEED Gold, WELL Silver, ASHRAE 90.1, ICC 500, NFPA 101), smart city standards (ISO 37122, ISO 27001, NIST 800-53), and military-grade security (smart airlocks, MIL-STD-461G). It achieves ~85–95% closed-loop efficiency for waste, water, nutrients, energy, and CO₂, with all components and kits available for sale.

## Introduction

The Luxe Living Complex is a visionary urban ecosystem that combines residential luxury, sustainable agriculture, and commercial functionality. It houses 150 residents in 75 apartments (30 one-bedroom for singles, 30 two-bedroom for small families, 15 three-bedroom for larger families), with integrated urban agriculture (from Prompt 2), a gourmet restaurant, gym, pool, sauna, hot tubs, and office spaces. All structures, furniture, electronics, appliances, linens, and towels are made in-house using ceramic-based kits and tiles, ensuring modularity, resilience, and sustainability. Smart airlocks and automation enhance security and urban compatibility, while viability enhancements (subsidies, Tesla partnerships, tile/kit sales) optimize costs and scalability.
