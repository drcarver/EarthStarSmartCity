# Earth-Star Industries Facility with Luxury Apartments

## Introduction
The **Earth-Star Industries Facility with Luxury Apartments** expands the original 150-meter-tall, 15-floor cylindrical high-rise (~265,000 m², height-to-diameter ratio ~1) to include luxurious apartments for 150 residents (singles and families), in-house produced furniture, home electronics, appliances, walk-in closets, in-suite bathrooms, linens, towels, office spaces, a gym, pool, sauna, hot tubs, and a gourmet restaurant. The facility remains a self-sufficient, closed-loop system integrating waste management, water recycling, energy generation, food production, and advanced manufacturing, achieving **Green Star 5 Star**, **Fitwel 3 Star**, **WELL Silver**, **LEED Gold**, **BREEAM Excellent**, **UN SDGs (3, 6, 7, 11, 12)**, NASA CELSS, and standards like **ISO 14644-1**, **ISO 52120-1**, **ISO 27001**, **ISO 37122**, NATO (e.g., STANAG 4370), military (e.g., MIL-STD-810H, MIL-STD-188-125-1), and building codes (ASHRAE 90.1, ICC 500, NFPA 101). 

Construction uses **171,750 Enhanced Ceramic Tiles** and **25,000 Smart Studs**, assembled via **DARPA BlockADE** and **Squad X AI-guided drones** (95% automation). **Smart airlocks** with weapon/explosive scanning ensure security. All kits (furniture, electronics, appliances, linens, towels) are produced in-house and available for sale, leveraging the facility’s ceramic manufacturing and waste recycling capabilities. Viability is enhanced through subsidies, partnerships, and optimized waste supply. Remaining space is allocated to office spaces with ceramic furniture.
