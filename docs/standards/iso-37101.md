# ISO 37101 – Sustainable Cities and Communities  
**Management Systems for Sustainable Development**  
**Genesis Network Governance & Implementation Reference**

**ISO 37101:2016** (updated 2023 amendments) provides a management system framework for organizations — including cities, communities, and enterprises — to establish, implement, maintain, and improve sustainable development outcomes. It is designed to integrate with other management system standards (e.g., **ISO 9001** quality, **ISO 14001** environmental) while focusing on the triple bottom line: people, planet, prosperity.

The Genesis Network adopts **ISO 37101** as its core governance backbone, ensuring all hubs, affiliates, and expansion phases operate under a unified, auditable system for continual improvement, stakeholder engagement, and alignment with **UN SDGs**.

## 1. Core Purpose & Structure of ISO 37101

- **Management System Approach** — Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle tailored to sustainable development  
- **Scope** — Applies to any organization (public/private, city-scale or enterprise) seeking to manage sustainability systematically  
- **Key Clauses**  
  - Context of the organization (stakeholder needs, risks/opportunities)  
  - Leadership & commitment (policy, roles, accountability)  
  - Planning (objectives, risk-based thinking)  
  - Support (resources, competence, awareness, communication)  
  - Operation (operational controls, emergency preparedness)  
  - Performance evaluation (monitoring, measurement, internal audit)  
  - Improvement (nonconformity, corrective action, continual enhancement)  

Genesis targets full certification readiness by 2030 (Level 4 maturity) and third-party certification by 2035 in mature hubs.
