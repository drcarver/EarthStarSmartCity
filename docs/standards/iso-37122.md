## Objective & Overview of **ISO 37122**

**ISO 37122** is an international standard providing key performance indicators (KPIs) for smart cities, focusing on data-driven metrics for sustainability, efficiency, and quality of life. It complements **[ISO/TC 268](docs/standards/iso-tc-268-smart-cities.md)** by emphasizing quantifiable outcomes in areas like energy, water, waste, transport, health, and digital infrastructure.

In the Genesis Network, **ISO 37122** integration ensures hubs and cities meet global smart city benchmarks, enabling certification for grants, credits, and partnerships. Compliance is achieved via **[dense sensor nets](docs/sensors/dense-sensor-net.md)**, **[digital twins](docs/digital-twins.md)**, and modular **[tiles](components/tiles.md)**/**[pods](components/pods.md)**/**[kits](components/kits.md)** that embed monitoring for real-time KPI tracking.

## Key **ISO 37122** Indicators & Genesis Compliance

- **Energy Efficiency**: Measured via kWh/m²; Genesis uses **[BIPV Glazing](components/tiles/roof-glazing-bipv.md)** and **[Piezo Tiles](components/tiles/permeable-road-path-tile.md)** for net-positive generation.
- **Water Management**: Leak detection, usage per capita; **[AWG Recovery](components/pods/awg-recovery-pod.md)** + sensors ensure 95–99% closure.
- **Waste Reduction**: Recycling rates; **[Infrastructure Recycling Kit](components/kits/infrastructure-recycling-kit.md)** and plasma processing achieve 70–95% waste-derived materials.
- **Transport KPIs**: EV charging availability, autonomous coverage; **[Autonomous Mobility LLC](innovation-hub/autonomous-mobility-llc.md)** with Tesla fleets and inductive roads.
- **Health & Safety**: Air quality, biosecurity; **[Smart Airlock Kit](components/kits/smart-airlock-kit.md)** and **[TerraWell FreeCare](innovation-hub/terrawell-freecare-llc.md)** integration.
- **Digital Inclusion**: Broadband access; **[Public WiFi Tiles](components/tiles/public-wifi-tile.md)** and **[Communicator Badge](components/pods/communicator-badge.md)** provide free/affordable connectivity.

Compliance Strategy: **[Standards Compliance Tile](components/tiles/standards-compliance-tile.md)** and **[Sustainable Code Tile](components/tiles/sustainable-code-tile.md)** embed KPIs; automated reporting via **[OS & Software LLC](innovation-hub/os-software-llc.md)**; third-party audits for certification.

## Recomputed Financial Impacts of **ISO 37122** Compliance

- **CAPEX Addition**: $20–$50M/hub (sensor embeds, audit software; offset 30–50% by grants like CHIPS/IRA).
- **OPEX**: 5–10% increase for monitoring ($10–$30M/year/hub; savings from efficiency gains +15–25%).
- **Revenue Uplift**: +10–20% ($50–$260M/year/hub) from premium certifications, credits ($150–$250/tCO₂e), and partnerships (e.g., smart city contracts).
- **Network-Wide (2050)**: +$50–$200B/year revenue; IRR uplift +3–5% (to 38–55%).
- **Payback**: 1–2 years via enhanced credits and market access.
