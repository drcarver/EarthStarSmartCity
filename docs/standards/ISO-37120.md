# ISO 37120 – Sustainable Cities and Communities  
**Indicators for City Services and Quality of Life**

**ISO 37120:2018** (and amendments) provides a standardized set of **100+ indicators** (18 core + supplementary) to measure city performance across 17 themes. It enables consistent benchmarking, reporting, and improvement of urban services and resident quality of life.

Genesis Network cities target full compliance and certification under **ISO 37120** by 2035–2040 in mature hubs.

## Core Themes & Selected Indicators Aligned with Genesis

| Theme                              | Core Indicators (Examples)                          | Genesis Implementation                                                                 | Measurement Method                  |

| **Economy**                        | Unemployment rate; GDP per capita                   | **Self-funding model**, **TerraFab** jobs, **smallholder revenue-share**               | % unemployment; local GDP/capita    |
| **Environment**                    | GHG emissions; green space per capita               | **Gigaton sequestration**, **blue-green carbon kits**, rewilding corridors             | tCO₂e/capita; m² green space/capita |

## Genesis Reporting & Certification Pathway

- **2027–2030**: Pilot hubs collect baseline data (core indicators)  
- **2031–2035**: Achieve **recognized** status (self-declared + third-party audit)  
- **2036+**: Pursue **certified** status (full external certification)  
- **Tools**: **Sensor handbook** + **data moat** for automated KPI tracking; blockchain-verified annual reports  

**Related Standards**  
- **[ISO 37123 – Resilience and Smartness](ISO-37123.md)** (complementary maturity model)  
- **[ITU-T Y.4900 – Smart Sustainable Cities](ITU-T-Y.4900.md)** (ICT integration)
