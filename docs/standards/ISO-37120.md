# ISO 37120 – Sustainable Cities and Communities – City Indicators

**ISO 37120** is the international standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that defines a comprehensive set of **city indicators** for measuring and reporting performance in sustainable development, resilience, and quality of life. First published in 2014 and updated periodically, it provides a consistent framework for cities worldwide to benchmark progress, improve governance, and communicate achievements transparently.

The Genesis Network adopts **ISO 37120** as a core compliance and reporting backbone for mature regenerative cities and hubs. All **smart city KPIs** tracked via embedded sensors, digital twins, and blockchain-verified logs align with or exceed **ISO 37120** requirements, enabling third-party certification, carbon credit validation, and attractiveness to aligned sovereign partners.

## Core Principles of ISO 37120 in Genesis Context

- **Holistic measurement**: Covers 17 themes and over 100 indicators (core + supporting) across economy, environment, governance, health, infrastructure, and society.  
- **Voluntary but rigorous**: Cities self-report but may seek third-party verification. Genesis hubs target full verification by 2035.  
- **Data-driven governance**: Indicators must be measurable, comparable, and transparent. Genesis uses **hyper-dense sensor arrays** (3–5× redundancy) and **edge AI** for real-time, tamper-proof data.  
- **Alignment with SDGs**: Directly supports **UN Sustainable Development Goals** (especially SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities).  

## Key ISO 37120 Themes & Genesis Network Alignment

| Theme                              | Core Indicators (Examples)                     | Genesis Network Implementation & Sensors | Target Maturity Level (2035+) |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Economy**                        | GDP per capita, unemployment rate, % of city budget from local sources | Revenue tracking via **blockchain credits** and hub financial dashboards | Full reporting + third-party audit |
| **Energy**                         | Total energy consumption per capita, % renewable energy | **BIPV solar + piezo tiles**, biogas microturbines; real-time **power metering sensors** | Net-positive surplus tracked daily |
| **Environment**                    | Fine particulate matter (PM2.5), GHG emissions per capita, % green space | **VOC/multispectral sensors**, **DAC pilots**, blue-green carbon kits; **sequestration credits** | Gigaton-scale verified |
| **Governance**                     | Voter participation, % women in city council, transparency index | **DAO/co-op governance** logs, public dashboards via **telepresence** portals | Full citizen participation metrics |
| **Health & Safety**                | Life expectancy, % population with access to healthcare, emergency response time | **TerraWell FreeCare** clinics, **mmWave health radar** in airlocks, pathogen scanning | 100% free access + real-time vitals |
| **Infrastructure**                 | % population with access to potable water, internet penetration, % roads in good condition | **AWG + digestate recovery**, **smart ceramic pipes**, **piezo/solar roads** | 95–99% closure; 100% smart infrastructure |
| **Waste & Water**                  | % solid waste diverted from landfill, water loss rate, wastewater treated | **ELFM/plasma vitrification**, **95–99% water recirculation** via **flow/pressure sensors** | Near-zero waste; aquifer recharge |
| **Recreation & Culture**           | % population within 500m of public open space, cultural facility access | **Biophilic housing**, rooftop greens, **education/telepresence hubs** | High livability score |

## Genesis-Specific Enhancements to ISO 37120

- **Regenerative Over Compliance**: Genesis exceeds baseline indicators (e.g., net-positive energy, carbon-negative, 95–99% closure) → qualifies for premium credits.  
- **Sensor Backbone**: Every indicator supported by **hyper-dense, 3–5× redundant sensors** (see **[Sensor Handbook](docs/sensor-handbook.md)**).  
- **Blockchain Verification**: All data logged immutably → third-party audits simplified.  
- **Smart Airlock Integration**: Pathogen/weapons scanning aligns with health/safety KPIs.  
- **Feedback Loops**: **NASA/ISS-derived ECLSS** principles enhance water/air metrics (see **[NASA/ISS Integration](roadmaps/nasa-iss-integration.md)**).  

## Reporting & Certification Pathway

1. **2027–2030**: Pilot hubs self-report core indicators via internal dashboards.  
2. **2030–2035**: Full **ISO 37120** alignment with third-party verification; begin certification process.  
3. **2035+**: Certified sustainable cities; leverage certification for global invitations and credit premiums.  

**ISO 37120** provides the universal language for Genesis Network performance, enabling benchmarking, credibility, and accelerated adoption.
