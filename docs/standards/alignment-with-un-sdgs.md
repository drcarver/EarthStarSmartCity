## Objective

The Genesis Network is explicitly designed to support and advance the **UN Sustainable Development Goals** (**SDGs**) through its regenerative, closed-loop hubs, smallholder empowerment, and circular economy principles. This document maps contributions across all 17 **SDGs**, highlights synergies with core components (e.g., **[TerraWell FreeCare LLC](innovation-hub/terrawell-freecare-llc.md)** for health, **[Nutrient Cycling LLC](innovation-hub/nutrient-cycling-llc.md)** for soil/carbon), quantifies impacts with metrics, shows financial benefits (credits, grants, revenues), and includes a sensor table for SDG monitoring/compliance.

Alignment is verified and enhanced via **[Standards Compliance Kit](components/kits/standards-compliance-kit.md)** and **[digital twins](docs/digital-twins.md)** for transparent reporting.
