# ISO 37122 – Sustainable Cities and Communities  
**Indicators for Smart Cities**

**ISO 37122:2019** is the international standard that defines a comprehensive set of **indicators** for measuring the performance of **smart sustainable cities**. It builds on **ISO 37120** (city services and quality of life indicators) by adding a specific focus on **smart** technologies, digital infrastructure, and data-driven governance.

The Genesis Network fully aligns with and exceeds many **ISO 37122** requirements through its **pod-centric architecture**, embedded sensors, **data moat**, and regenerative closed-loop systems.

## Core Purpose of ISO 37122

The standard provides **100+ indicators** across 19 themes to help cities:

- Benchmark smart city performance  
- Track progress toward sustainability goals  
- Demonstrate transparency to citizens and investors  
- Support evidence-based policy and investment decisions  

It is voluntary, non-prescriptive, and designed to be adaptable to cities of any size, geography, or development stage.

## Key Themes & Selected Indicators Relevant to Genesis Network

| Theme                              | Example ISO 37122 Indicators                          | Genesis Network Implementation & Evidence                                                                 | Linked Documentation |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Energy**                         | Renewable energy share, energy intensity, smart grid readiness | 100% renewable microgrids (BIPV tiles, biogas); real-time energy balancing via **smart infrastructure** | [Smart Infrastructure Kit](components/smart-infrastructure-kit.md) |
| **Water & Sanitation**             | Water reuse rate, non-revenue water, smart metering   | 95–99% water closure via AWG + digestate recovery; leak detection via acoustic sensors                     | [Water Balance Table](financials/water-balance.md) |
| **Transport**                      | Public transport coverage, EV charging points, smart mobility | **Smart roads** with inductive charging, robotaxi integration, piezo energy harvest                        | [Smart Roads & Pipes](components/smart-infrastructure-kit.md) |
| **ICT & Innovation**               | Broadband coverage, open data portal, R&D expenditure | Dense sensor network + **data moat**; open-source subset of dashboards; sovereign chip production         | [Sensor Handbook](docs/sensor-handbook.md) |
| **Governance & Citizen Engagement**| E-participation, open data policy, transparency index | **Telepresence** education hubs, blockchain-verified carbon credits, co-op governance models              | [Education & Telepresence](components/education-telepresence.md) |
| **Environment & Climate**          | GHG emissions per capita, air quality index, green space ratio | Gigaton sequestration via biochar + agroforestry; real-time air quality via multispectral sensors         | [Carbon Balance](financials/carbon-balance.md) |
| **Safety & Security**              | Crime rate, emergency response time, cybersecurity readiness | **Smart airlocks** with weapons/explosives scanning; AI anomaly detection; Faraday mesh EMP protection    | [Smart Airlock & Security](components/smart-airlock-security.md) |

## Integration into Genesis Network

Every mature hub is designed to collect and report the majority of **ISO 37122** indicators automatically through:

- Hyper-dense embedded sensors (3–5× redundancy)  
- Edge AI processing for real-time KPIs  
- Blockchain-verified logs for auditability  
- Public dashboards (subset) for citizen transparency  

This enables Genesis cities to:

- Self-certify against **ISO 37122** with minimal external audit  
- Attract impact investment and carbon credit buyers  
- Benchmark performance against global peers  
- Demonstrate leadership in **smart sustainable cities**

## Compliance & Reporting

Genesis hubs support automated generation of:

- Annual **ISO 37122** performance reports  
- Alignment mapping to **UN SDG 11** (Sustainable Cities)  
- Third-party verification pathways (optional)
