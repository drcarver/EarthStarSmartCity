# Genesis-STD-001  
**Pod-Centric Regenerative Architecture**  
**Version 1.0 – January 21, 2026**

This standard defines the core architectural principle of the **Genesis Network**: all functions, infrastructure, and services begin and primarily operate within modular **40 ft high-cube ISO container pods**, evolving to **waste-derived toughened ceramic shells** for maximum resilience, mobility, and self-replication.

## 1. Purpose & Scope

- Enable **rapid bootstrap** (cash-positive Month 1–3 per hub)  
- Minimize permitting delays (temporary/mobile classification)  
- Isolate risks via **pod-level redundancy**  
- Support **exponential replication** (hubs produce kits for new sites)  
- Facilitate **cultural/religious adaptations** in global rollout  
- Ensure compliance with **ISO/TC 268**, **ITU-T Y.4900**, and sustainable building codes  

Applies to all **pods**, interconnects, and transitions to fixed structures.

## 2. Base Pod Specifications

| Specification                      | Requirement                                                                 | Rationale / Notes |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Base Form Factor**               | 40 ft high-cube ISO container (12.192 × 2.438 × 2.896 m)                    | Global shipping compatibility; easy transport |
| **Early Shell**                    | Recycled steel with insulation                                              | Low initial cost; rapid deployment |
| **Mature Shell**                   | 95–100% waste-derived toughened ceramic (60–100+ MPa compressive)           | Radiation/ballistic resistance; munitions 8–9/10 |
| **Cladding & Glazing**             | Snap-on **tiles** (**BIPV** 10–30%, embedded sensors, **Faraday mesh**)     | Power generation, monitoring, EMP protection |
| **Power**                          | 5–20 kW (**BIPV** + biogas microturbine + piezo floors); sodium-ion batteries | 2–5 days autonomy; off-grid capable |
| **Water**                          | 95–99% closure (**AWG**, rainwater, digestate recovery)                     | Self-sufficient for 30–90 days |
| **Airlocks**                       | Dual smart airlocks (**mmWave/multispectral** scanning, UV/HEPA)            | Biosecurity, weapons/explosives/pathogen detection |
| **Automation**                     | Lights-out robotics + **RISC-V** edge AI                                    | Minimal human oversight |
| **Mobility**                       | Autonomous wheeled/tracked/amphibious movers                                | Relocation during disasters |
| **Interconnects**                  | Smart ceramic pipes (bidirectional power/water/waste/data/slurry/bee transit) | Hub clustering & resource sharing |

## 3. Pod Classification & Variants

| Pod Category                       | Examples                                                                    | Primary Function | Transition Trigger to Fixed |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Production**                     | **Ceramic Tile Production**, **Microbial Inoculant**, **Mini-Fab**          | Manufacturing & replication | Volume > pod capacity |
| **Biological**                     | **Enhanced Aquaponics**, **Livestock** (large/specialty), **Orchard**       | Food & fiber production | Scale or vibration needs |
| **Community**                      | **Housing/Community**, **Education/Telepresence**, **TerraWell Dispenser**  | Resident services | Density requirements |
| **Infrastructure**                 | **Biogas Digester**, **Smart Infrastructure**, **Restoration & DAC Pilot**  | Energy/resource loops | Regulatory or safety |
| **Specialty**                      | **Beehive**, **Processing** (bakery/brewery/etc.), **Smart Airlock**        | Niche functions | N/A (remain pod-based) |

## 4. Manufacturing & Input Requirements

- **All pods** manufactured in **Tile Production Pods** using **waste-derived toughened ceramics** (70–95% input from C&D slag, RHA silica, farm residues, ELFM/brownfield slag)  
- **Self-replication rule**: Mature hubs produce kits for new pods (target 4–5× replication rate)  
- **Input minimums**: 70% waste-derived by 2030; 95% by 2035  
- **Cost target**: $80–300K per pod (mature phase); 20–30% reduction via pre-supply & recycling  

## 5. Integration & Standards Compliance

- **Inter-pod connections**: Bidirectional smart ceramic pipes (power/water/waste/data)  
- **Smart city alignment**: **[ISO/TC 268](../standards/iso-tc-268.md)**, **[ITU-T Y.4900](../standards/itu-t-y4900.md)**, **[ISO 37123](../standards/iso-37123.md)**  
- **Biosecurity**: Mandatory **[smart airlocks](../components/smart-airlock-security.md)** in all pods  
- **Sensor density**: 3–5× redundancy per critical point; see **[Sensor Handbook](../docs/sensor-handbook.md)**  
- **Resilience**: Vaulted designs, **Faraday mesh**, thermal mass; see **[Resilience Analysis](../docs/resilience-analysis.md)**  

## 6. Transition to Fixed Structures

Fixed buildings (barns, factories, cities) only authorized when pod limits are exceeded:  
- Volume/capacity thresholds  
- Vibration-sensitive processes  
- Regulatory requirements  
- Density needs  

All fixed structures must use **tiles**, ceramics, and kits exclusively; no virgin materials unless justified.

## 7. Version History & Review

- **v1.0** – January 21, 2026 – Initial release  
- **Review cycle**: Annual, updated via **data moat** feedback
