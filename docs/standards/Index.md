## New Standards Created for Genesis Network

The following are project-specific standards documents generated to formalize Genesis-unique requirements and exceed baseline international norms.

### 1. **[Genesis-STD-001 – Pod-Centric Regenerative Architecture](genesis-std-001.md)**  
Defines modular 40 ft high-cube pod requirements, ceramic evolution, interconnects, mobility, and replication rules.

### 2. **[Genesis-STD-002 – Smart Airlock & Biosecurity Protocol](genesis-std-002.md)**  
Mandatory airlock specs: mmWave/multispectral scanning, weapons/explosives/pathogen detection, UV/HEPA sterilization, AI alert integration.

### 3. **[Genesis-STD-003 – Hyper-Dense Sensor & Data Moat Standard](genesis-std-003.md)**  
3–5× redundancy rules, edge AI processing, privacy (local/anon), blockchain logging for audits, integration with IEEE 1451 & OGC SWE.

### 4. **[Genesis-STD-004 – Resource Closure & Circularity Metrics](genesis-std-004.md)**  
95–99% closure targets for water, nutrients, materials; waste-derived input minimums (70–95%); Cradle-to-Cradle alignment.

### 5. **[Genesis-STD-005 – Resilience & Disaster Recovery Framework](genesis-std-005.md)**  
Specific thresholds for earthquakes, floods, nuclear winter, pandemics; Faraday mesh, underground variants, stockpiles, recovery KPIs.

### 6. **[Genesis-STD-006 – Smallholder Empowerment & Affiliate Kit Protocol](genesis-std-006.md)**  
Bridge loan structures, kit subsidies, revenue-share models, cultural/religious adaptations for global rollout.

### 7. **[Genesis-STD-007 – Space-Earth Feedback Loop Standard](genesis-std-007.md)**  
Bidirectional integration rules with NASA/ISS-derived tech (BLSS/ECLSS), lunar/Mars extension requirements.
