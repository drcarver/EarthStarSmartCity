# Genesis Network: **ISO 37102**

## Objective

**ISO 37102** provides standardized vocabulary for sustainable cities and communities, ensuring consistent terminology for planning, development, and management. In the Genesis Network, this standard is integrated to define regenerative concepts, support compliance with smart city frameworks (**[ISO/TC 268](docs/standards/iso-tc-268-smart-cities.md)**), and enhance interoperability with **[dense sensor nets](docs/sensors/dense-sensor-net-handbook.md)**, **[digital twins](docs/digital-twins.md)**, and modular construction. This detailed version adapts **ISO 37102** terms to Genesis-specific elements like closed-loop hubs, biophilic density, and all-electric systems.

## Key Adapted Vocabulary from **ISO 37102**

- **Sustainable Community**: A hub or city achieving 95–99% resource closure through regenerative practices, including **[BIPV glazing](components/tiles/roof-glazing-bipv.md)** for energy and **[AWG recovery](components/pods/awg-condensate-recovery-pod.md)** for water.
- **Regenerative Hub**: A self-replicating ecosystem (500–2,500 ha) with **[productive core](docs/regenerative-city-layout.md)** zones producing net surplus food/energy/materials.
- **Biophilic Integration**: Design incorporating 15% **[nature corridors](docs/regenerative-city-layout.md)** with **[restoration kits](components/kits/restoration-blue-green-carbon-kit.md)** for biodiversity and well-being.
- **Closed-Loop System**: Circular flows where waste from **[biogas digester pod](components/pods/biogas-digester-pod.md)** becomes feedstock for **[nutrient cycling LLC](innovation-hub/nutrient-cycling-llc.md)**.
- **Productive Density**: 40–60% built area with **[vertical ag expansion kit](components/kits/vertical-ag-expansion-kit.md)** for +30–50% yield without extra land.
- **All-Electric Primary**: Energy model using **[battery & storage LLC](innovation-hub/battery-storage-llc.md)** sodium-ion tiles, with biogas methane backup.
- **Smart Airlock**: Mandatory entry system in all buildings using **[smart airlock kit](components/kits/smart-airlock-kit.md)** for security/biosecurity.

## Compliance Strategies

- Align Genesis layouts (**[regenerative city & hub layout principles](strategy/regenerative-city-hub-layout-principles.md)**) with **ISO 37102** terms for sustainable reporting.
- Use **[standards compliance tile](components/tiles/standards-compliance-tile.md)** and **[sustainable code tile](components/tiles/sustainable-code-tile.md)** for automated metrics.
- Integrate with **[OS & Software LLC](innovation-hub/os-software-llc.md)** for data aggregation and **[blockchain-integrated credits](innovation-hub/blockchain-credits-platform.md)** for verifiable sustainability claims.

## Financial Impacts of **ISO 37102** Implementation

- **CAPEX Addition**: $20–$50M/hub (sensor embeds, compliance software; offset 30–50% by grants like IRA 45X).
- **OPEX Savings**: 5–10% ($10–$30M/year/hub) via optimized resource flows.
- **Revenue Uplift**: +10–20% ($50–$260M/year/hub) from premium credits/certifications (e.g., $150–$250/tCO₂e) and market access.
- **IRR Contribution**: +3–5% (network IRR 35–50%).
- **Timeline**: Compliance integrated from bootstrap (2027–2030); full certification 2031–2035.
