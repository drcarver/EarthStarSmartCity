# Genesis Network: **ISO 37103**

## Objective

**ISO 37103** provides standardized vocabulary for smart cities, ensuring consistent terminology for sustainable urban development, ICT integration, and performance metrics. In the Genesis Network, it guides regenerative hub/city planning to align with global smart city frameworks, enabling interoperability, benchmarking, and certification. This document details how Genesis implements **ISO 37103** terms (e.g., "smart infrastructure," "resilience," "circular economy") through modular **[tiles](components/tiles.md)**, **[pods](components/pods.md)**, **[kits](components/kits.md)**, and **[dense sensor nets](docs/sensors/dense-sensor-net.md)**, supporting sustainable building codes (**[ISO 14001](docs/standards/iso-14001-environmental.md)**) and smart city standards (**[ISO/TC 268](docs/standards/iso-tc-268-smart-cities.md)**, IEEE 2030, ITU-T Y.4900).

## Key Vocabulary & Implementation in Genesis

- **Smart Infrastructure**: Defined as ICT-enabled urban systems for efficiency/resilience. Genesis implements via **[Basic Networking Snap Tile](components/tiles/basic-networking-snap-tile.md)** for mmWave/inductive data, **[RTK GNSS Anchor Tile](components/tiles/rtk-gnss-anchor-tile.md)** for positioning, and **[Smart Infrastructure Pod](components/pods/smart-infrastructure-pod.md)** for microgrids.
- **Resilience**: Capacity to absorb/recover from shocks. Achieved through 90+ day isolation, **[Energy Storage & Thermal Tile](components/tiles/energy-storage-thermal-tile.md)** for distributed power, and **[Smart Airlock Module Tile](components/tiles/smart-airlock-module-tile.md)** for biosecurity.
- **Circular Economy**: Resource loops minimizing waste. Genesis uses 70–95% waste-derived materials in all **[tiles](components/tiles.md)** and **[kits](components/kits.md)**, with **[Infrastructure Recycling Kit](components/kits/infrastructure-recycling-kit.md)** for RCA bases.
- **Digital Twin**: Virtual replica for simulation. Genesis **[digital twins](docs/digital-twins.md)** model hubs/cities for optimization, fed by **[Dense Sensor Net Kit](components/kits/dense-sensor-net-kit.md)**.
- **Sustainable Development**: Balanced economic/environmental/social growth. Aligned via **[Regenerative Hubs LLC](innovation-hub/regenerative-hubs-llc.md)** closure (95–99%), biophilic layouts, and **[TerraWell FreeCare LLC](innovation-hub/terrawell-freecare-llc.md)** amenities.

## Financial Impacts of **ISO 37103** Compliance

Compliance accelerates permitting (+10–20% timeline), unlocks grants/credits (+$50–$150M/hub/year), and enables premium branding (+20–40% margins). Recomputed (February 2026 baseline: efficiencies +10–15%, credits $150–250/tCO₂e):

- **CAPEX Addition**: $20–$50M/hub (sensor embeds, audit tools; offset by grants 30–50%).
- **OPEX**: 15–25% of revenue (compliance monitoring via **[Standards Compliance Tile](components/tiles/standards-compliance-tile.md)**).
- **Annual Revenue Uplift**: +$100–$300M/hub (certification premiums, credits, contracts).
- **IRR Contribution**: +4–8% to network (overall 35–50%).
- **NPV Uplift**: +$0.2–$0.5T (faster scaling via standards alignment).

## List of Sensors in a Separate Table

Sensors ensure **ISO 37103** compliance (e.g., "performance indicators" for energy/water/carbon); integrated in all **[tiles](components/tiles.md)**/**[pods](components/pods.md)**/**[kits](components/kits.md)**.
