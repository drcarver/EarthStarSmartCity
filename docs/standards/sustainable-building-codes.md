## Objective

The Genesis Network ensures all structures comply with leading **sustainable building codes** (e.g., **[ISO 14001](docs/standards/iso-14001-environmental.md)**, Cradle-to-Cradle, LEED, BREEAM) by using waste-derived toughened ceramics (70–95% recycled), modular **[tiles](components/tiles/tile-catalog.md)**/**pods](components/pods/pod-catalog.md)**/**kits](components/kits/kit-catalog.md)**, and embedded sensors for real-time monitoring. This achieves net-positive environmental impact, energy/water independence, and sequestration while generating premium credits/revenues.

## Key Compliance Features & Integration

- **Materials Sustainability**: All buildings constructed solely from **[waste-derived ceramics](docs/materials/waste-derived-ceramics.md)** (C&D slag, RHA silica, farm residues); recyclable/biodegradable; no virgin mining except trace criticals.
- **Energy/Water Efficiency**: **[BIPV Glazing](components/tiles/roof-glazing-bipv.md)** + **[piezo tiles](components/tiles/permeable-road-path-tile.md)** for generation; **[AWG & Condensate Recovery](components/systems/awg-condensate-recovery.md)** for water; 95–99% closure certified via audits.
- **Biophilic Design**: 15% nature corridors with **[Restoration Kits](components/kits/restoration-blue-green-carbon-kit.md)**; living walls/roofs for air quality/sequestration.
- **Security/Health**: **[Smart Airlock Module Tile](components/tiles/smart-airlock-module-tile.md)** in all buildings for biosecurity; **[Dense Sensor Net Kit](components/kits/dense-sensor-net-kit.md)** for monitoring.
- **Standards Alignment**: **[ISO/TC 268](docs/standards/iso-tc-268-smart-cities.md)** for smart integration; Cradle-to-Cradle for circularity; bird-safe glazing, permeable surfaces for stormwater.
- **Synergies**: Ties to **[Energy Systems LLC](innovation-hub/energy-systems-llc.md)** for microgrids; **[Nutrient Cycling LLC](innovation-hub/nutrient-cycling-llc.md)** for soil amendments; **[Standards Compliance Tile](components/tiles/standards-compliance-tile.md)** for automated reporting.

## Recomputed Financials (Network-Wide, February 2026 Baseline)

- **CAPEX Impact**: Compliance adds 5–10% to building costs ($17–$37M/hub; offset by grants/credits).
- **OPEX Savings**: Energy/water efficiencies reduce 15–25% ($50–$150M/hub/year).
- **Revenue Streams**: Premium credits ($150–$250/tCO₂e sequestration + green building certs) $100–$300M/hub/year; affiliate kit sales with compliance embeds +$50–$150M/year.
- **Annual Revenue Uplift**: +10–20% from certifications ($50–$100B/year network-wide by 2040).
- **IRR Contribution**: +5–8% (network IRR 35–50%).
- **Timeline**: Compliance built-in from bootstrap (2027–2030); certifications achieved Month 6–12 per hub.

## List of Sensors in a Separate Table

Sensors ensure code compliance via real-time monitoring (energy use, water quality, sequestration, structural integrity).
