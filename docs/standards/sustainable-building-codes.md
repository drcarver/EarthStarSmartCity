# Genesis Network – Sustainable Building Codes

The Sustainable Building Codes standard in the Genesis Network ensures full ISO 14001 compliance for environmental management systems, integrated directly into the design and construction of all hubs, structures, and components. This enables regenerative practices, waste minimization, and verifiable sustainability, generating carbon credits valued at $10–30M/year per hub through sequestration and efficiency gains. It applies across tiles, pods, and kits, supporting closed-loop operations and smart city certifications.

## Viability & Integration Notes

The Sustainable Building Codes standard ensures ISO 14001 compliance across all Genesis components, integrating waste-derived materials and embedded sensors for verifiable environmental management. This drives carbon credits ($10–30M/year/hub) while enabling smart city certifications, reducing regulatory risks, and enhancing market appeal for tiles/pods/kits. All buildings incorporate smart airlocks for security scanning, aligning with MIL-STD-810 and ITU-T Y.4900 standards.
