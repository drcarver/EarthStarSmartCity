# Genesis-STD-004  
**Resource Closure & Circularity Metrics**  
**Genesis Network Project Standard**  
**Version 1.0 – January 21, 2026**

## 1. Purpose & Scope

**Genesis-STD-004** establishes mandatory quantitative targets, measurement protocols, and verification procedures for achieving **95–99% resource closure** and full **circularity** across all hubs, pods, and cities in the Genesis Network.

This standard applies to:
- Water, nutrients, energy, materials, and waste streams  
- All **pod-centric architecture** components, tiles, and kits  
- Integration with **smart airlocks**, **hyper-dense sensors**, and **data moat** for real-time tracking  
- Reporting for **blockchain credits** and third-party audits  

It exceeds baseline requirements of **ISO 14001**, **Cradle-to-Cradle**, and **ISO 37123** by enforcing near-total loop closure and waste-as-resource transformation.

## 2. Core Definitions

- **Resource Closure** — Percentage of input resources (water, energy, nutrients, materials) that are recovered, reused, or recycled within the system boundary without external discharge or loss.  
- **Circularity Rate** — Proportion of material inputs derived from recycled, waste-derived, or regenerative sources (target: ≥70–95%).  
- **System Boundary** — Individual hub/pod → cluster → city → regional network (multi-scale reporting required).  

## 3. Quantitative Targets (Minimum Thresholds)

| Resource Stream                  | Target Closure Rate | Target Circularity Rate | Measurement Frequency | Compliance Deadline (Mature Hubs) |
|----------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Water**                        | 95–99%               | 90–98% (AWG + digestate + rainwater) | Continuous (sensors)  | 2030                               |
| **Nutrients (N, P, K)**          | 92–98%               | 85–95% (microbial inoculants + BSFL conversion) | Monthly               | 2032                               |
| **Energy**                       | Net-positive (100%+ surplus possible) | 80–95% (biogas + BIPV + piezo) | Continuous            | 2029                               |
| **Materials (ceramics, aggregates)** | 90–98%           | 70–95% (C&D slag, RHA, ELFM) | Per production batch  | 2030                               |
| **Organic Waste**                | 95–99%               | 90–98% (biogas + biochar + feed loops) | Weekly                | 2031                               |
| **Overall System Closure**       | ≥95%                 | ≥85%                     | Annual audit          | 2035 (Level 5 maturity)            |

## 4. Measurement & Verification Methods

| Metric                           | Primary Sensors / Tools                                      | Calculation Formula                                      | Verification Method                     |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Water Closure                    | Flow, pressure, humidity, AWG output sensors                 | (Recovered + Reused) / Total Input × 100                | Continuous logging + annual third-party |
| Nutrient Closure                 | Electrochemical nutrient sensors, microbial activity probes  | (Nutrients in outputs + soil retention) / Inputs × 100   | Lab sampling + data moat cross-check    |
| Energy Closure                   | Power meters, BIPV/piezo sensors, biogas flow                | (Generated – Exported) / Consumed × 100                  | Smart grid compliance (IEEE 2030)       |
| Material Circularity             | Mass balance tracking in tile factory pods                   | (Waste-derived mass) / Total mass × 100                  | Batch certification + blockchain logs   |
| Organic Waste Closure            | VOC, weight sensors in biorefinery/digesters                 | (Processed – Residual) / Generated × 100                 | Weekly audit + biochar yield tracking   |

All sensors comply with **[hyper-dense sensor & data moat standard](genesis-std-003.md)** and **[IEEE 1451](ieee-1451.md)**.

## 5. Reporting & Compliance Requirements

- **Real-Time Dashboard** — Edge AI aggregates closure metrics; displayed in **[telepresence/education hubs](education-telepresence.md)**  
- **Blockchain Logging** — Immutable, auditable records for carbon/biodiversity credits ($150–250/tCO₂e)  
- **Annual Third-Party Audit** — Independent verifier assesses against targets; results published publicly  
- **Non-Compliance Triggers** — <90% closure in any stream → mandatory corrective action within 90 days  

## 6. Integration with Other Standards

- **[ISO 14001](iso-14001.md)** – Environmental management framework  
- **[Cradle-to-Cradle](cradle-to-cradle.md)** – Circular material certification  
- **[ISO 37123](iso-37123.md)** – Resilience indicators tied to closure performance  
- **[Genesis-STD-001 – Pod-Centric Architecture](genesis-std-001.md)** – Requires 95%+ closure in all pods  

## 7. Exceptions & Flexibility

- Early pilot hubs (2027–2029): Minimum 85% closure acceptable during ramp-up  
- Saltwater aquaponics pilots: Adjusted targets for brine management (still ≥90% closure)  
- Extreme disaster recovery: Temporary relaxation allowed with documented recovery plan  

This standard is enforced network-wide and updated annually via **data moat** feedback.
