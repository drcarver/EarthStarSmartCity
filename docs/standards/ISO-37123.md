# ISO 37123 – Sustainable Cities and Communities  
**Resilience and Smartness Maturity Model**  
**Genesis Network Implementation Reference**

**ISO 37123:2019** defines a framework and set of indicators for assessing the **resilience** and **smartness** maturity of cities and communities. It complements **ISO 37120** (city services and quality of life) by focusing on preparedness, response, recovery, and adaptive capacity in the face of shocks and stresses — both sudden (disasters) and chronic (climate change, resource scarcity).

The Genesis Network explicitly aligns with **ISO 37123** to ensure regenerative cities are not only sustainable but demonstrably resilient and progressively smarter over time.

## 1. Core Purpose & Structure of ISO 37123

- **Resilience** — Ability to absorb, adapt to, and recover from shocks/stresses while maintaining essential functions  
- **Smartness** — Use of data, technology, and governance to improve performance and quality of life  
- **Maturity Model** — 5 progressive levels (Initial → Managed → Defined → Quantitatively Managed → Optimizing)  
- **Indicator Categories** (core + supplementary)  
  - Governance & Strategy  
  - Preparedness & Planning  
  - Infrastructure & Built Environment  
  - Social & Community  
  - Economy & Finance  
  - Environment & Natural Resources  

Genesis targets **Level 4 (Quantitatively Managed)** by 2035 and **Level 5 (Optimizing)** by 2045–2050 in mature hubs.

## 3. Genesis-Specific Resilience & Smartness Enhancements

- **Smart Airlocks** → Pathogen/weapons scanning aligns with **public safety** indicators  
- **Faraday Mesh** in ceramics → EMP/nuclear resilience exceeds baseline requirements  
- **Closed-Loop ECLSS** principles → Water/air/food autonomy for **chronic stress** (drought, nuclear winter)  
- **Distributed Hub Model** → No single point of failure; aligns with **decentralized infrastructure** indicator  
- **Data Moat** → Real-time KPIs and predictive analytics drive **quantitative management** (Level 4) and **optimization** (Level 5)  
- **Pod Mobility** → Rapid relocation during disasters supports **adaptive capacity**
