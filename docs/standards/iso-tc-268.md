# ISO/TC 268 – Sustainable Cities and Communities  
**Genesis Network Implementation Guide**  
**January 21, 2026**

## Overview

**ISO/TC 268** is the International Organization for Standardization technical committee responsible for developing standards for **sustainable cities and communities**. It provides frameworks, indicators, and management systems that enable cities, regions, and organizations to measure, report, and improve sustainability performance across economic, social, environmental, and governance dimensions.

In the Genesis Network, **ISO/TC 268** serves as the primary reference for smart city interoperability, performance monitoring, and regulatory alignment. All hubs, towers, and distributed mini-hubs are designed to comply with its core standards, ensuring compatibility with global sustainable development goals (SDGs), investor requirements, and potential future municipal adoption.

## Key ISO/TC 268 Standards Implemented

| **ISO 37101**                     | Sustainable development in communities — Management system for sustainable development | Environmental management system (EMS) implemented across hubs; annual audits for ISO 14001 alignment | [ISO 37101](docs/standards/ISO-37101.md) |
| **ISO 37104**                     | Sustainable cities and communities — Framework for integrating city systems | Interconnection of pods, smart pipes, microgrids, and restoration zones via bidirectional ceramic infrastructure | [ISO 37104](docs/standards/ISO-37104.md) |
| **ISO 37106**                     | Sustainable cities and communities — Guidance on establishing smart city operating models | AI-driven governance, digital twins, and telepresence decision-making loops | [ISO 37106](docs/standards/ISO-37106.md) |
| **ISO 37110**                     | Sustainable cities and communities — Vocabulary | Standardized terminology across all documentation and stakeholder communications | [ISO 37110](docs/standards/ISO-37110.md) |

## Compliance & Monitoring Mechanisms

- **Real-time KPI Dashboard**: Edge AI aggregates **hyper-dense sensor** data into **ISO 37120/37122** indicators; blockchain-verified logs for audits and credits.  
- **Annual Reporting**: Automated portal generates ISO-compliant sustainability reports for regulators, investors, and carbon markets.  
- **Certification Pathway**: Phased alignment with **ISO 37101** EMS; third-party audits targeted 2030–2035.  
- **Integration with Other Standards**: Cross-referenced with **IEEE 2030** (smart grid), **ITU-T Y.4900** (sustainable cities performance), and **ISO 14001** (environmental management).  

## Sensor Integration for ISO/TC 268 Compliance

The following table lists sensors that directly support **ISO/TC 268** KPIs, with hyperlinks to detailed entries.
