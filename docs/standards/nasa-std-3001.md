## Objective

This document provides a completely detailed adaptation of **NASA-STD-3001** (Space Flight Human-System Standard) for the Genesis Network's off-world components, ensuring human safety, performance, and habitability in lunar/Mars outposts and future habitats. It aligns with Genesis principles of regenerative, closed-loop systems, incorporating ceramic tiles/pods, all-electric energy (sodium-ion backups), and biophilic design. **NASA-STD-3001** Volumes 1 (Crew Health) and 2 (Human Factors, Habitability, Environmental) are customized for Genesis modularity and self-replication.

## Key Adaptations & Integration

- **Crew Health (Vol. 1)**: Focus on preventive care via **[TerraWell FreeCare LLC](innovation-hub/terrawell-freecare-llc.md)** modules; biosensors in **[Communicator Badge](components/communicator-badge.md)** for real-time HR/SpO₂/radiation monitoring; closed-loop nutrition from **[Aquaponics Pod](components/pods/aquaponics-pod.md)** and **[Vertical Ag Expansion Kit](components/kits/vertical-ag-expansion-kit.md)**.
- **Human Factors & Habitability (Vol. 2)**: Biophilic interiors with living walls (from **[Canopy Microclimate Tile](components/tiles/canopy-microclimate-tile.md)**); daylight simulation via BIPV glazing; ergonomic furniture from **[Furniture Production Kit](components/kits/furniture-production-kit.md)**; noise/vibration mitigation with insulating tiles.
- **Environmental Controls**: All-electric life support (AWG from **[Water Sovereignty LLC](innovation-hub/water-sovereignty-llc.md)**, biogas methane backup only); radiation shielding via water bladders/ceramics; air quality via smart airlocks and **[Dense Sensor Net Kit](components/kits/dense-sensor-net-kit.md)**.
- **Genesis-Specific Enhancements**: Modular pods for habitat expansion; AI/digital twins for predictive health/maintenance; cultural accommodations (multi-faith spaces, halal/kosher processing).

## Standards Compliance & Requirements

- **Alignment with NASA-STD-3001**: Full compliance for crew health (e.g., radiation limits <500 mSv/year), habitability (e.g., 63 dBA noise max), environmental (e.g., 21% O₂, CO₂ <0.5%).
- **Smart City/Sustainable Codes**: Integrates **[ISO/TC 268](docs/standards/iso-tc-268-smart-cities.md)** for off-world "cities"; **[ISO 14001](docs/standards/iso-14001-environmental.md)** for regenerative loops.
- **Off-World Extensions**: Radiation-hardened variants for Luna/Mars; ISRU ceramics from local regolith.

## Recomputed Financial Impact (Off-World Pilots, Network-Wide)

- **CAPEX**: $800B–$3T (2045–2070 for lunar/Mars; down 10–15% via all-electric simplification).
- **OPEX**: 25–35% of revenue (automation + closure).
- **Annual Revenue**: $100–$500B/year (2060+ from mining/data; margins 60–80%).
- **Revenue Uplift**: +10–20% ($10–$100B/year) from NASA synergies (e.g., ECLSS data sharing).
- **IRR Contribution**: +5–10% to network (overall 35–50%).
- **Timeline**: Pilots 2045–2055; mature settlements 2055–2070.
