## Executive Overview

The Genesis Network applies **ISO 9001:2015** as the foundational quality management system for all tile and pod production processes. Certification scope covers raw material intake, mixing, forming, embedding, firing, inspection, and packaging in both initial tent-based Tile Production Pods and mature permanent ceramic factories. The system ensures consistent product quality, traceability, continuous improvement via the data moat, and customer (internal hub & affiliate) satisfaction while maintaining 70–95% waste-derived material usage and lights-out automation targets (80–95% by 2035). All processes are audited quarterly with blockchain-verified logs for compliance and credit verification.

## Viability & Integration Notes

- ISO 9001 ensures consistent quality across tent → permanent factory transition.  
- Data moat (dense sensors + digital twins) drives continuous improvement, targeting 98%+ first-pass yield by 2035.  
- All production remains 100% on-site via Tile Production Pods → closed-loop traceability.  
- Strict separation from TerraWell FreeCare maintains nonprofit firewall while supporting internal quality for humanitarian goods.
