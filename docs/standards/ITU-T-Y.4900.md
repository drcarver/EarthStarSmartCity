# ITU-T Y.4900 – Smart Sustainable Cities Performance Indicators

**ITU-T Y.4900** is the core recommendation series published by the **International Telecommunication Union** (ITU) under the **Y.4900** family (also known as **Y.Smart-City**). It defines a global framework of **key performance indicators (KPIs)** for evaluating and benchmarking **smart sustainable cities**.

The series provides a standardized, measurable way to assess how well a city integrates information and communication technologies (ICT) to improve quality of life, economic competitiveness, environmental sustainability, and governance — while remaining aligned with the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**.

## Core Objectives of ITU-T Y.4900

The standard aims to:
- Enable cities to self-assess and compare performance
- Support evidence-based policy making
- Facilitate international benchmarking and knowledge sharing
- Promote transparency and citizen engagement
- Align urban development with **SDG 11** (Sustainable Cities and Communities)

## Structure of the Y.4900 Series (as of 2025)

| Recommendation | Title / Focus | Key Content | Genesis Network Relevance |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **Y.4900**     | Overview and general principles | Framework, core concepts, indicator categories | Defines overall smart city maturity model used across hubs |
| **Y.4901**     | Core set of indicators | 18 core KPIs across 6 dimensions | Primary compliance target for all Genesis cities |
| **Y.4902**     | Economic dimension | GDP contribution, innovation, employment | Tracked via **TerraFab** output and smallholder revenue |
| **Y.4903**     | Environmental dimension | CO₂ emissions, renewable energy, waste recycling | Mapped to gigaton sequestration, **DAC pilots**, waste-derived ceramics |
| **Y.4904**     | Social dimension | Education, health, inclusion | Directly supported by **TerraWell FreeCare** and education pods |
| **Y.4905**     | Governance dimension | Transparency, citizen participation | Implemented via co-op/DAO governance and blockchain credits |
| **Y.4906**     | Mobility & transport | Smart roads, public transport, accessibility | Covered by **smart infrastructure** pods (piezo/solar roads) |
| **Y.4907**     | Safety & security | Disaster resilience, crime prevention | Integrated via **smart airlocks**, security kits, and distributed redundancy |

## Genesis Network Compliance Mapping (Core Indicators – Y.4901)

| Dimension | Core Indicator (Y.4901) | Genesis Network Metric | Monitoring Method | Target (Mature Hub) |
|-----------|--------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Economy   | GDP per capita growth    | Revenue per capita from hubs/affiliates | Financial dashboards | +15–25% annual growth |
| Economy   | Innovation (patents/R&D) | Sovereign chip production, microbial patents | **TerraFab** output logs | 50–200 patents/year |
| Environment | CO₂ emissions per capita | Net-negative MtCO₂e/year | Sensor + blockchain verification | –4.5–13.5 MtCO₂e/year |
| Environment | Renewable energy share   | Biogas + BIPV + piezo share | Energy balance sensors | 95–100% renewable |
| Social    | Access to education      | Competency-based modules via **telepresence** pods | Enrollment & completion rates | 100% free access |
| Social    | Access to healthcare     | **TerraWell FreeCare** reach | Patient visits + DME distribution | 100% free coverage |
| Governance | E-participation index    | Co-op/DAO voting participation | Blockchain logs | >80% resident engagement |
| Mobility  | Public transport coverage| **Smart roads** + robotaxi integration | Traffic & usage sensors | 90% coverage within hubs |
| Safety    | Disaster resilience index| Airlocks, redundancy, closed loops | Simulation + real-event response | 7.5–8.5/10 rating |

## Implementation in Genesis Cities

- **Sensor Backbone**: Every tile, pod, and building integrates **hyper-dense sensors** (3–5× redundancy) compliant with **IEEE 1451** and **OGC SWE**. Data feeds real-time KPI dashboards. See **[Sensor Handbook](docs/sensor-handbook.md)**.
- **Smart Airlocks**: Mandatory in all structures; mmWave + multispectral scanning for weapons/explosives/pathogens; alerts routed to AI/security. See **[Smart Airlock & Security Kit](components/smart-airlock-security.md)**.
- **Sustainable Codes**: Full alignment with **ISO 14001** (environmental management), **Cradle-to-Cradle** principles, and **ITU-T Y.4900** reporting.
- **Blockchain Verification**: Sequestration, energy, and social KPIs logged immutably for global benchmarking.

## Benefits for Genesis Network

- Attracts international partnerships and grants (ITU-aligned cities qualify for UN-Habitat, World Bank, and development bank funding)
- Enables global benchmarking and voluntary adoption under open invitation phase
- Provides transparent proof of performance to residents, affiliates, and defense partners
- Strengthens resilience narrative (high KPI scores in safety/environment/governance)
