# ISO 37110 – Sustainable Cities and Communities — Vocabulary  
**Genesis Network Implementation Reference**

**ISO 37110:2023** provides standardized terminology for **[sustainable cities and communities](../docs/standards/iso-tc-268.md)**, ensuring consistent communication across stakeholders, policymakers, planners, and implementers. It defines essential concepts related to sustainability, resilience, smartness, and quality of life in urban and community contexts.

The Genesis Network adopts **ISO 37110** as the foundational vocabulary framework to align all documentation, stakeholder communications, and reporting with international standards. This ensures clarity, interoperability, and credibility when describing **[regenerative hubs](../components/regenerative-hubs.md)**, **[pod-centric architecture](../components/pods-catalog.md)**, and **[closed-loop systems](../docs/closed-loop-systems.md)**.

## Purpose and Scope of ISO 37110

**ISO 37110** establishes a common language for:
- Describing **[sustainable development](../docs/sustainable-development.md)** goals in urban settings  
- Defining **[resilience](../docs/resilience-analysis.md)**, **[smartness](../docs/standards/iso-37123.md)**, and **[circularity](../docs/circularity-metrics.md)**  
- Supporting related standards such as **[ISO 37120](../docs/standards/iso-37120.md)** (indicators), **[ISO 37122](../docs/standards/iso-37122.md)** (smart cities), and **[ISO 37123](../docs/standards/iso-37123.md)** (resilience)  

In the Genesis Network, **ISO 37110** vocabulary is mandatory for all technical specifications, financial reporting, and public communications to maintain consistency and facilitate global adoption.

## Key Terms from ISO 37110 (Genesis-Specific Applications)

| Term (ISO 37110)                   | Definition (Paraphrased)                                | Genesis Network Application                                                                 | Related Component/Link |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Sustainable City**               | Urban area that meets present needs without compromising future generations | **[Regenerative hubs](../components/regenerative-hubs.md)** achieving 95–99% closure and gigaton sequestration | [Regenerative Hubs](../components/regenerative-hubs.md) |
| **Resilience**                     | Capacity to absorb, adapt, and recover from shocks/stresses | Distributed **[pod-centric architecture](../components/pods-catalog.md)** with redundancy and **[smart airlocks](../components/smart-airlock-security.md)** | [Resilience Analysis](../docs/resilience-analysis.md) |
| **Smart City**                     | Use of data/technology to enhance performance and wellbeing | **[Data moat](../docs/data-moat.md)** + **[dense sensor nets](../components/dense-sensor-nets.md)** for optimization | [Smart City Standards](../docs/standards/itu-t-y4900.md) |
| **Circular Economy**               | System minimizing waste through reuse/recycling         | **[Waste-derived ceramics](../components/tiles-catalog.md)** and **[closed-loop systems](../docs/closed-loop-systems.md)** (70–95% inputs from waste) | [Circularity Metrics](../docs/circularity-metrics.md) |
| **Quality of Life**                | Wellbeing derived from city services and environment     | Free amenities via **[TerraWell FreeCare](../docs/terrawell-freecare.md)** and biophilic design | [TerraWell FreeCare](../docs/terrawell-freecare.md) |
| **Governance**                     | Decision-making processes for sustainable development   | **[Innovation Hub LLC structure](../docs/llc-structure.md)** + co-op models | [LLC Structure](../docs/llc-structure.md) |

## Integration with Genesis Network Standards

**ISO 37110** serves as the terminology backbone for:
- **[Genesis-STD-004 – Resource Closure & Circularity Metrics](../docs/standards/genesis-std-004.md)**  
- **[Genesis-STD-005 – Resilience & Disaster Recovery Framework](../docs/standards/genesis-std-005.md)**  
- All **[financials](../financials/) reporting** (e.g., sequestration credits aligned with sustainability indicators)  

Compliance ensures Genesis cities qualify as **[sustainable cities](../docs/sustainable-cities.md)** under international frameworks, facilitating partnerships and funding.
