# Genesis-STD-007  
**Space-Earth Feedback Loop Standard**  
**Version 1.0 – January 21, 2026**  
**Genesis Network Project – Earth-Star Industries**

## 1. Purpose & Scope

**Genesis-STD-007** establishes the mandatory requirements and protocols for creating, maintaining, and continuously improving **bidirectional feedback loops** between:

- **NASA/ISS-derived technologies** and experiments  
- **Earth-based Genesis regenerative hubs**  
- Future **lunar and Mars settlements**  

The standard ensures that space-proven innovations accelerate Earth hub performance, while Earth-scale data and testing refine technologies for off-world application. This creates a virtuous cycle that enhances overall project viability, reduces R&D risk, and positions the Genesis Network as a backbone for interplanetary regenerative infrastructure.

## 2. Normative References

- **[NASA ECLSS/BLSS Guidelines](nasa-std-3001.md)** – Bioregenerative life support systems  
- **[ISO 37123](iso-37123.md)** – Resilience and smartness maturity model

## 3. Definitions

- **Space-Earth Feedback Loop** — A structured, documented process where data, lessons learned, or optimized designs flow in both directions between space-based experiments and Earth hubs.  
- **Space-to-Earth Loop** — Transfer of space-derived knowledge (e.g., microgravity microbial behavior) to improve Earth systems.  
- **Earth-to-Space Loop** — Transfer of Earth-validated technologies, data, or materials to enhance lunar/Mars mission performance.  
- **Interplanetary Maturity Level** — Progressive scale (1–5) measuring loop effectiveness, aligned with **ISO 37123** maturity model.

## 4. Core Requirements

### 4.1 Mandatory Feedback Mechanisms

- Sensitive data (e.g., advanced fab yields) encrypted and access-controlled  
- Open datasets published under CC BY 4.0 where permitted  
- Annual **interplanetary maturity assessment** report published in repository  

### 4.3 Maturity Progression Requirements

| 2     | Managed (structured quarterly reports)           | 2030–2032                      |
| 3     | Defined (formal bidirectional protocols)         | 2033–2035                      |
| 4     | Quantitatively Managed (KPIs & automated loops)  | 2036–2045                      |
| 5     | Optimizing (self-improving via AI & lunar data)  | 2046+                          |

## 5. Sensor Integration Requirements

The following **[sensors](../sensor-handbook.md)** are mandatory for feedback loop validation:
