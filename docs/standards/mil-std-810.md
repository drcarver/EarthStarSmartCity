# MIL-STD-810  
**Environmental Engineering Considerations and Laboratory Tests**

**MIL-STD-810H** (latest) defines test methods for equipment ruggedness under extreme environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, shock, vibration, salt fog, sand/dust, etc.).

Genesis Network applies **MIL-STD-810** compliance to sensors, pods, tiles, and airlocks for disaster resilience.

## Key Tests & Genesis Mapping

| Method                             | Test Description                                    | Genesis Application                                                                    | Target Level |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 501/502 – High/Low Temperature     | Extreme hot/cold exposure                           | Ceramic thermal mass; **BIPV** de-icing traces                                         | Method 501.7/502.7 Proc I/II |
| 507 – Humidity                     | Cyclic condensation                                 | **AWG channels** + sealed airlocks                                                     | Method 507.6 Proc II |
| 514 – Vibration                    | Transportation & operational vibration              | Piezo embeds + strain sensors for monitoring                                           | Method 514.8 Category 4 |
| 516 – Shock                        | Functional & crash hazard shock                     | Vaulted ceramic designs; snap-together modules                                         | Method 516.8 Proc I |
| 520 – Temperature/Humidity/Vibration | Combined environment                                | Full pod testing for resilience                                                        | Method 520.4 Proc II |
