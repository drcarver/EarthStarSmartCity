## Objective

**ASTM C109** (Standard Test Method for Compressive Strength of Hydraulic Cement Mortars Using 2-in. or [50 mm] Cube Specimens) is integrated into the Genesis Network to ensure the structural integrity and compliance of waste-derived toughened ceramic tiles and hybrid materials used in **[foundation tiles](components/tiles/foundation-base-tile.md)**, **[exterior cladding](components/tiles/exterior-cladding.md)**, and **[permeable road tiles](components/tiles/permeable-road-path-tile.md)**. This standard verifies compressive strengths (60–100+ MPa) for modular construction, supporting **[ISO 14001](docs/standards/iso-14001-environmental.md)** sustainability and smart city codes.

## Key Integration & Compliance Details

- **Application in Genesis**: **ASTM C109** testing applied to ceramic composites (C&D slag + RHA silica) during manufacturing in **[Tile & Pipe Production Pod](components/pods/tile-pipe-production-pod.md)**; ensures tiles meet MIL-STD-810G durability for resilience.
- **Testing Methods**: Cube specimens molded from ceramic mixtures; cured 28 days; compressive load applied via hydraulic press; results fed to **[digital twins](docs/digital-twins.md)** for optimization.
- **Modifications for Ceramics**: Hybrid with ASTM C469 (modulus of elasticity) for toughened materials; waste-derived binders tested for 70–95% recycled content.
- **Benefits**: Verifies net-positive structures; enables green building credits (+$50–$150M/hub/year); reduces failure risks in disasters.

## Recomputed Financials for Standard Compliance (Network-Wide, February 2026 Baseline)

- **CAPEX Impact**: $20–$50M additional for testing equipment/presses (integrated into **[TerraFab Manufacturing LLC](innovation-hub/terrafab-manufacturing-llc.md)**); offset by 10–15% material efficiencies.
- **OPEX**: 5–10% of tile production costs ($10–$30M/year/hub for testing); reduced via AI automation.
- **Revenue Uplift**: +$100–$300M/year/hub from premium certified tiles (margins +15–25% via compliance premiums); credits $150–$250/tCO₂e.
- **IRR Contribution**: +3–5% to network (overall 35–50%).
- **Timeline**: Compliance pilots 2028–2030; full integration 2031+ (no delays; enhances market access).
