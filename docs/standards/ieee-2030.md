## Objective

The Genesis Network implements the **[IEEE 2030](docs/standards/ieee-2030.md)** standard for smart grid interoperability to ensure seamless communication, integration, and resilience across distributed energy resources (DERs), microgrids, and all-electric systems. This standard provides a reference model for interoperability among electricity, communications, and information technology, aligning with the Network's closed-loop, self-powered design using **[sodium-ion storage tiles](components/tiles/energy-storage-thermal-tile.md)**, **[BIPV glazing](components/tiles/roof-glazing-bipv.md)**, **[piezo tiles](components/tiles/permeable-road-path-tile.md)**, and biogas methane backup.

Implementation focuses on all-electric primary energy (inductive charging, battery-dominant storage) with biogas integration for backup, supporting smart city standards (**[ISO/TC 268](docs/standards/iso-tc-268-smart-cities.md)**) and sustainable codes (**[ISO 14001](docs/standards/iso-14001-environmental.md)**). It enhances viability by enabling microgrid leasing revenue (+$200–$400M/hub/year) and reducing energy losses 10–20%.

## Key Implementation Features

- **Interoperability Layers**: Follows IEEE 2030's three layers (power, communications, information) for DER integration.
  - Power Layer: **[Microgrid leasing](strategy/microgrid-leasing.md)** with sodium-ion batteries and **[waste heat recovery](components/pods/waste-heat-recovery-pod.md)**.
  - Communications Layer: **[Basic Networking Snap Tile](components/tiles/basic-networking-snap-tile.md)** for mmWave/inductive data; Matter/Thread protocols.
  - Information Layer: **[OS & Software LLC](innovation-hub/os-software-llc.md)** digital twins for real-time optimization.
- **All-Electric Focus**: Inductive charging in roads/paths; rebranded Tesla Superchargers; biogas methane fuel cells as backup only (via **[Biogas Digester Pod](components/pods/biogas-digester-pod.md)**).
- **Security & Resilience**: **[Smart Airlock Kit](components/kits/smart-airlock-kit.md)** for access control; Faraday mesh in tiles for EMP; 90+ day isolation.
- **Synergies**: Integrates with **[Autonomous Mobility LLC](innovation-hub/autonomous-mobility-llc.md)** for vehicle-to-grid (V2G); **[Sustainable Energy LLC](innovation-hub/sustainable-energy-llc.md)** for DER management.

## Recomputed Costs & Revenues (Network-Wide, February 2026 Baseline)

- **CAPEX**: $50–$150M network-wide for IEEE 2030 compliance (sensors/software; down 5–10% via all-electric simplicity).
- **OPEX**: 15–25% of energy revenue (monitoring/optimization).
- **Annual Revenue Uplift**: +$10–$30B/year (2040s) from interoperable microgrid leasing and efficiency credits.
- **IRR Contribution**: +3–5% to network (overall 35–50%).
- **Timeline**: Implementation 2028–2030 (pilots); mature 2031–2035.
