# Genesis Network: **ISO 37123**

## Objective

**ISO 37123** defines indicators for assessing and improving city resilience across economic, environmental, social, and infrastructural dimensions. In the Genesis Network, it is implemented via modular **[tiles](components/tiles.md)**, **[pods](components/pods.md)**, and **[kits](components/kits.md)** to ensure hubs and cities withstand shocks (disasters, pandemics, economic downturns) while maintaining regenerative performance. Compliance is achieved through **[dense sensor nets](docs/sensors/dense-sensor-net-kit.md)** for real-time monitoring, **[digital twins](docs/digital-twins.md)** for predictive analytics, and closed-loop systems for autonomy.

## Key Implementation Strategies

- **Economic Resilience Indicators**: Track self-funding via revenue from **[tiles](components/tiles.md)**, food, and **[kits](components/kits.md)**; diversification through 32 **[LLCs](innovation-hub/innovation-hub-llcs.md)**.
- **Environmental Resilience**: **[Biochar & Soil Amendment Kit](components/kits/biochar-soil-amendment-kit.md)** and **[Restoration (Blue-Green Carbon) Kit](components/kits/restoration-blue-green-carbon-kit.md)** for sequestration; **[AWG & Condensate Recovery](components/pods/awg-condensate-recovery-pod.md)** for water security.
- **Social Resilience**: **[TerraWell FreeCare LLC](innovation-hub/terrawell-freecare-llc.md)** for health; biophilic layouts with **[Nature Corridors](docs/regenerative-city-layout.md)**.
- **Infrastructural Resilience**: **[Smart Airlock Kit](components/kits/smart-airlock-kit.md)** in all buildings; **[Permeable Road / Path Tile](components/tiles/permeable-road-path-tile.md)** for flood resistance; 90+ day isolation via **[Energy Storage Starter Kit](components/kits/energy-storage-starter-kit.md)**.
- **Standards Synergy**: Aligns with **[ISO/TC 268](docs/standards/iso-tc-268-smart-cities.md)** (smart cities), **[ISO 14001](docs/standards/iso-14001-environmental.md)** (environmental management), and **[IEEE 2030](docs/standards/ieee-2030-smart-grid.md)** (smart grid).

## Recomputed Financial Impacts of Compliance

- **CAPEX Addition**: $20–$50M/hub for sensor embeds/airlocks (offset by grants/credits).
- **OPEX Savings**: 10–20% via predictive maintenance (+$50–$150M/hub/year).
- **Revenue Uplift**: +15–25% from resilience credits/contracts ($150–$350M/hub/year); e.g., disaster-proof certification premiums.
- **Network-Wide (2050)**: +$50–$150B/year revenue; IRR uplift +5–10% (to 40–60%).
- **Timeline**: Compliance pilots 2028–2030; full integration 2031–2035 (no delays; built-in from bootstrap).
