# Genesis-STD-003  
**Resource Closure & Circularity Metrics**

**Executive Overview**  
Genesis-STD-003 establishes the quantifiable benchmarks for achieving 95–99% resource closure across all network operations. Closure is defined as the percentage of inputs (water, energy, nutrients, materials) that are recovered, reused, or recycled within the system, minimizing external dependency. Circularity metrics track waste valorization, material loops, and carbon-negative performance. All measurements are validated by redundant sensor arrays and digital twins, with blockchain-verified reporting for credits and compliance.

## Viability & Integration Notes

Resource closure & circularity are foundational to Genesis viability. Metrics are continuously validated via dense sensor arrays and blockchain reporting, enabling premium carbon/biodiversity credits ($150–250/tCO₂e). Integration with pods (biogas, microbial, aquaponics) and tiles (AWG, piezo, thermal mass) creates compounding loops: higher closure → more surplus → faster replication → greater sequestration → higher credits. Bottlenecks (e.g., early feedstock variability) are mitigated through pre-supply staging and parallel testing. Projected impact: 1.3–3.5 MtCO₂e net sequestration per mature hub annually.
