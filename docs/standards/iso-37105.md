# Genesis Network: **ISO 37105**

## Objective

**ISO 37105** provides a descriptive framework for sustainable cities and communities, focusing on indicators for performance assessment, interoperability, and holistic urban planning. In the Genesis Network, it is integrated to ensure regenerative hubs (500–2,500 ha) and emerging cities align with global sustainability benchmarks, enhancing credibility for grants, credits, and international licensing. This enables verifiable reporting on energy closure, biodiversity, and social well-being via **[digital twins](docs/digital-twins.md)** and **[dense sensor nets](docs/sensors/dense-sensor-net.md)**.

## Key Integration Elements

- **Framework Application**: Genesis uses **ISO 37105**'s descriptive indicators for city profiling, covering economic, environmental, social, and governance dimensions. Hubs track metrics like carbon sequestration (via **[Biochar & Soil Amendment Kit](components/kits/biochar-soil-amendment-kit.md)**), water sovereignty ( **[Water Sovereignty LLC](innovation-hub/water-sovereignty-llc.md)**), and inclusive housing ( **[Food Desert Housing Starter Kit](components/kits/food-desert-housing-starter-kit.md)**).
- **Compliance Strategies**: Embed indicators into **[OS & Software LLC](innovation-hub/os-software-llc.md)** for automated dashboards; third-party audits via **[Standards Compliance Tile](components/tiles/standards-compliance-tile.md)**; align with **[ISO 14001](docs/standards/iso-14001-environmental.md)** for environmental management.
- **Smart City Synergies**: Supports **[ISO/TC 268](docs/standards/iso-tc-268-smart-cities.md)** through **[Smart Infrastructure Pod](components/pods/smart-infrastructure-pod.md)** and **[Basic Networking Snap Tile](components/tiles/basic-networking-snap-tile.md)** for data interoperability.
- **Sustainability Focus**: All structures use **[Sustainable Code Tile](components/tiles/sustainable-code-tile.md)** for Cradle-to-Cradle certification; **[Smart Airlock Module Tile](components/tiles/smart-airlock-module-tile.md)** ensures security compliance.

## Recomputed Financials for ISO 37105 Implementation (Network-Wide, February 2026 Baseline)

- **CAPEX**: $50–$150M (2027–2030 for sensor embeds/audits; down 5–10% via existing **[Dense Sensor Net Kit](components/kits/dense-sensor-net-kit.md)** synergies).
- **OPEX**: 10–15% of revenue (ongoing audits/reporting; offset by automation).
- **Annual Revenue Uplift**: +$100–$300B/year (2040+) from premium credits/grants (e.g., enhanced sequestration at $150–$250/tCO₂e); margins 70–85%.
- **IRR Contribution**: +5–8% to network (overall 35–50%).
- **Timeline**: Compliance pilots 2027–2029; full certification 2030–2035 (accelerated 6 months via **[Data Moat](docs/data-moat.md)**).
