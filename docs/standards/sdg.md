# UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – Genesis Network Alignment

The **Genesis Network** is explicitly designed to advance all **17 UN Sustainable Development Goals** (SDGs), with many targets either directly met or significantly progressed through its regenerative, closed-loop, and community-focused architecture. This document maps each SDG to key Genesis components, indicators of progress, and alignment maturity as of 2026 planning baseline.

## Overview of Alignment

The project achieves **high-to-full alignment** with **SDG 2, 6, 7, 11, 13, 15** (core regenerative focus) and **strong contributions** to **SDG 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17**. By 2035–2050, mature hubs aim to deliver measurable progress toward **2030 Agenda** targets at city/region scale, with verifiable data via **blockchain credits** and **ISO 37123** resilience reporting.
