## 3. Revenue Breakdown (Mature Network, 2060+)

| Revenue Stream                        | % of Total | Annual Contribution ($T) | Key Enablers |
|---------------------------------------|------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| Tiles & Infrastructure                | 25–35%     | 2.5–10.5                 | Waste-derived dominance |
| Food/Protein/Premiums                 | 20–30%     | 2.0–9.0                  | Silvopasture + aquaponics |
| Electronics & Appliances              | 15–25%     | 1.5–7.5                  | TerraFab sovereignty |
| Energy/Water/Gases                    | 10–15%     | 1.0–4.5                  | Biogas + industrial gases |
| Carbon/Biodiversity Credits           | 8–12%      | 0.8–3.6                  | Blockchain verification |
| Infrastructure Contracts & Licensing  | 5–10%      | 0.5–3.0                  | Smart roads/pipes |
| Education/Tourism/Other               | 5–8%       | 0.5–2.4                  | Telepresence immersion |

## 4. Key Sensitivities & Risk-Adjusted Scenarios

- **Base Case** (55–80% IRR): As above — disciplined execution, 8,000+ hubs.  
- **Delayed Case** (+10–15 years): Regulatory/political drag → IRR 40–65%, NPV $5–25T.  
- **Catastrophic Case** (nuclear winter/supervolcano): 40–70% hub survival → recovery in 5–20 years; IRR drops to 20–40%.  
- **Optimistic Case** (accelerated adoption): 12,000–20,000 hubs by 2060 → IRR 80–110%, NPV $30T+.

This financial model assumes strict self-funding discipline, revenue-first prioritization, and relentless data-moat optimization.
