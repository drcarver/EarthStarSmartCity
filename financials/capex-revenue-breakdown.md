# CAPEX and Revenue Breakdown  
**Detailed Financial Analysis per Tile, Pod, Kit, and Component**  
**Genesis Network Master Plan**  
**January 21, 2026**

This document provides a comprehensive breakdown of **Capital Expenditures (CAPEX)** and **revenue projections** for all major components of the Genesis Network, including **tiles**, **pods**, and **kits**. All figures are recalculated based on mature-phase efficiencies (2035+), incorporating waste-derived inputs (70–95%), automation gains, microbial yield boosts (+10–30%), and premium pricing from regenerative/carbon-negative attributes. Costs reflect 20–25% reductions from pre-supply and data moat optimizations; revenues uplifted 25–35% from blockchain credits ($150–250/tCO₂e) and defensive/space synergies.
