# CAPEX and Revenue Breakdown  
**Genesis Network Financial Analysis**  
**by Earth-Star Industries**  
**January 21, 2026**

This document provides a granular, recalculated financial breakdown for the core components of the **Genesis Network**. All figures are network-wide mature phase (2035+) unless otherwise noted, assuming self-funding post-2028–2029 and incorporating efficiencies from **waste-derived inputs**, **data moat** optimization, **microbial inoculants**, and **NASA/ISS-derived** closed-loop enhancements.

Costs reflect production from **tile factory pods**; revenues include premium pricing, **blockchain credits** ($150–250/tCO₂e), and internal utilization offsets.
