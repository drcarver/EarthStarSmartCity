# Cash Flow Summary  
**Genesis Network Financial Projections (2027–2077)**  
**by Earth-Star Industries**  
**Last Updated: January 21, 2026**

This document provides a consolidated, phased cash flow projection for the entire **Genesis Network**, reflecting self-funding after the 2028–2029 break-even milestone. All figures are network-wide (U.S. domestic + Fortress West + global open invitation phases) in billions of USD ($B/year unless noted).

## Key Assumptions

- Self-funding achieved network-wide by **2028–2029** (no external capital post-pilot phase)  
- Revenue growth driven by: food/protein, tiles, sovereign chips, infrastructure contracts, **blockchain credits**, premium exports  
- CAPEX peaks 2030–2045 (fabs, global scaling), then declines as replication efficiencies improve  
- OPEX: 32–42% of revenue (automation reduces labor/energy costs over time)  
- Uplift from **NASA/ISS integration** and **space feedback loops**: +5–10% IRR, +10% revenue by 2040s
