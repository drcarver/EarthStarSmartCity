# Electronics & Appliances Financials

This document provides the comprehensive financial model for **TerraFab** semiconductor production (sensors, edge AI, robotics compute) and in-house **consumer electronics & appliances** (DC-native refrigerators, ovens, lighting, entertainment systems, etc.). All manufacturing occurs in modular pod-based cleanrooms using waste-derived silicon (rice husk ash) and recycled electronics, achieving 65–95% internal closure.

## 1. Production Pathway & Input Sources

- **Silicon Source**: Rice husk ash (RHA) silica → metallurgical-grade silicon → solar-grade wafers (mature-node 65–130 nm). Recycled electronics (e-waste plasma processing) supplies 20–40% of trace metals/dopants.
- **Gases**: Internal **industrial gases** pods supply N₂, Ar, O₂, H₂; rare gases (neon/krypton) initially imported, phased to in-house ASUs post-2035.
- **Substrates & Masks**: Ceramic/glass-ceramic substrates from **tile factory**; photomasks via in-house laser patterning (mature-node).
- **Packaging & Assembly**: Ceramic chip carriers + flip-chip bonding in ISO 7–5 cleanroom pods.
- **Appliances**: DC-native designs (no AC inverters); ceramic-embedded heating elements, RISC-V control boards, self-produced sensors/actuators.

**Manufacturing Location**: TerraFab Mini-Fab pods → permanent cleanroom clusters co-located with hubs (brownfield sites).
