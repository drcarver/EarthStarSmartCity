## Overview

The **Genesis Network** is a pod-centric, self-replicating regenerative ecosystem that transforms distressed farmland, brownfields, and closed landfills into closed-loop hubs delivering food, energy, water, materials, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and community services at 95–99% resource closure.

Built on **NASA/ISS-derived** closed-loop principles and powered by a massive data moat from dense sensor networks, the Network is fully self-funded through early revenue from **[tiles](components/tiles/)**, premium food, biogas, and infrastructure contracts.

This repository contains all specifications, roadmaps, financials, and strategy documents.

## Overview

The **Genesis Network** is a scalable, pod-centric regenerative system that transforms brownfields, closed landfills, and distressed farmland into closed-loop hubs achieving 95–99% resource closure. It produces food, energy, water, toughened ceramics, electronics, and community services while sequestering gigatons of carbon, rewilding millions of acres, and empowering smallholder farmers through subsidized kits and loans.

Core principles:  
- **Pod-first bootstrap** – All functions launch in 40 ft high-cube pods  
- **Self-funding** – Early revenue from greens, tiles, biogas, tipping fees  
- **Data moat** – Hyper-dense sensors + short-cycle iteration  
- **Farmer empowerment** – Bridge loans, training, revenue-share co-ops  
- **TerraWell FreeCare** – Independent nonprofit for free humanitarian services  
- **Circular economy** – 70–95% waste-derived ceramics; recycling via plasma
