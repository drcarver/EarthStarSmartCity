# Genesis Network Project README

## Project Overview

The Genesis Network is a scalable, self-replicating regenerative ecosystem developed by Earth-Star Industries. It transforms distressed lands, brownfields, and landfills into carbon-negative hubs that produce food, energy, water, materials, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and community services with 95–99% resource closure. The project aims to achieve post-scarcity abundance, internalizing U.S. goods and services by the 2060s–2070s while rewilding 200–400 million acres and sequestering gigatons of CO₂.

Key features include:
- Modular ceramic tiles and flat-pack kits for rapid deployment.
- Innovation Hub with 19 LLCs for parallel execution and risk isolation.
- Farmer/smallholder partnerships for distributed scaling and political alignment.
- TerraWell FreeCare nonprofit for humanitarian impact.
- Data moat flywheel for ruthless optimization via AI and short-cycle iterations.

The network is self-funded through early revenues from greens, tiles, waste tipping, and biogas, with short-term grants accelerating pilots. By 2050, it targets 500 hubs supporting 50,000 affiliates, generating $500–1,000 billion in annual revenue.

For more details, see the [Master Plan](web/masterplan.md).
