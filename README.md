# Earth-Star Industries Project

Earth-Star Industries is a pioneering project for building sustainable, resilient, and self-sufficient urban districts using Enhanced Ceramic Tiles and Smart Studs. Starting with a central facility, it expands to farms, household kits, smart city complexes, and national-scale housing for the entire US population (~340 million). The project leverages 2025 mass-production technologies (e.g., CVD ceramics, drone/robotics, modular prefab) for off-grid, closed-loop systems that achieve LEED Gold, WELL Silver, ISO 37122 smart city standards, and UN SDGs (3, 6, 7, 11, 12). All structures use tiles, studs, and kits from the tile factory, with 95% automation via Skydio drones, Optimus robots, and DARPA-inspired assembly.
