## Overview

The **Genesis Network** is a pod-centric, self-replicating regenerative ecosystem that transforms distressed farmland, brownfields, and closed landfills into closed-loop hubs delivering food, energy, water, materials, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and community services at 95–99% resource closure.

Built on **NASA/ISS-derived** closed-loop principles and powered by a massive data moat from dense sensor networks, the Network is fully self-funded through early revenue from **[tiles](components/tiles/)**, premium food, biogas, and infrastructure contracts.

This repository contains all specifications, roadmaps, financials, and strategy documents.

## Sensor Handbook – Dense Network Standard

Every tile, pod, and structure deploys **3–5× redundant sensors** for optimization, compliance, security, and off-world planning.
