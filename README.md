## Overview

The **Genesis Network** is a scalable, pod-centric regenerative system that transforms brownfields, closed landfills, and distressed farmland into closed-loop hubs achieving 95–99% resource closure. It produces food, energy, water, toughened ceramics, electronics, and community services while sequestering gigatons of carbon, rewilding millions of acres, and empowering smallholder farmers through subsidized kits and loans.

Core principles:  
- **Pod-first bootstrap** – All functions launch in 40 ft high-cube pods  
- **Self-funding** – Early revenue from greens, tiles, biogas, tipping fees  
- **Data moat** – Hyper-dense sensors + short-cycle iteration  
- **Farmer empowerment** – Bridge loans, training, revenue-share co-ops  
- **TerraWell FreeCare** – Independent nonprofit for free humanitarian services  
- **Circular economy** – 70–95% waste-derived ceramics; recycling via plasma  

## Core Components

- **[Pod-Centric Architecture](components/pod-centric-architecture.md)** – Modular, mobile 40 ft pods evolve to ceramic shells  
- **[Toughened Ceramic Tiles](components/toughened-ceramic-tiles.md)** – Waste-derived, embedded BIPV/AWG/piezo/sensors  
- **[Enhanced Aquaponics Pods](components/enhanced-aquaponics-pods.md)** – Multi-trophic (fish, prawns, mussels, BSFL, plants)  
- **[Livestock Pods](components/livestock-pods.md)** – Large/specialty animals with staggered delivery  
- **[TerraFab Electronics & Appliances](components/terrafab-electronics.md)** – Mini-fab to advanced (65–3 nm)  
- **[TerraWell FreeCare System](docs/terrawell-freecare-system.md)** – Standalone 501(c)(3) humanitarian layer  
- **[Farmer & Smallholder Partnerships](strategy/farmer-partnerships.md)** – Loans, kits, co-ops  
- **[Restoration & Blue-Green Carbon Kits](components/restoration-kits.md)** – Wetlands, mangroves, kelp, oysters
