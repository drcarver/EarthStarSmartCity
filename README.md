# Genesis Network README

## Project Overview

The Genesis Network is a modular, regenerative, closed-loop ecosystem developed by Earth-Star Industries. It transforms distressed farmland, brownfields, and landfills into self-sustaining hubs producing food, energy, water, high-value materials, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and community services while achieving 95–99% resource closure. Inspired by NASA BLSS/ECLSS principles but optimized for terrestrial scalability, the system bootstraps via high-margin outputs like hydroponic greens, biogas, and ceramic tiles, achieving self-funding by 2029.

Key features:
- **Innovation Hub**: 19 specialized LLCs for parallel execution, risk isolation, and reduced burnout/oversight strain.
- **Affiliate Model**: Empowers 10,000–50,000 smallholders with kits, loans, and training.
- **Environmental Impact**: Rewilds 200–300M acres, sequesters gigatons of CO₂ via biochar, agroforestry, and DAC.
- **Community Benefits**: Free food/power/water/housing/education/healthcare via integrated modules and TerraWell nonprofit.

For more details, see the [Master Plan](master-plan.md).

## Financial Summary

**Network-Wide Projections (2027–2050, $B)**:  
- Cumulative CAPEX: 20–30 (offset 15–25% by grants like USDA REAP, EPA Brownfields).  
- Revenue Ramp: Starts at 0.1 (2027), reaches 500–1,000 by 2050 (food 30%, materials/electronics 40%, credits/contracts 30%).  
- Cash Flow: Negative -0.1 to -1.65 early (2027–2030); positive ramp to +285 by 2050.  
- NPV (7% discount): 400–700.  
- IRR: 28–38%.  
- Break-Even: 2032.  

Electronics/Appliances LLC contributes +400–750B by 2050 via high margins (60–80%) on TVs, chargers, drones, and trade-ins.
