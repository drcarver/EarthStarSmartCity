# Earth-Star Industries Part 6A – Global Open Access Programme (2065–2120)

## Executive Summary

Upon reaching 70 % completion of the “Fortress West” programme (approximately 1,876 districts operational and revenue-positive across NATO + Western Hemisphere partners, projected 2065 in aggressive case), Earth-Star Industries opens the Genesis/MHUE ecosystem to any sovereign nation that is **not** on the current U.S. State Sponsors of Terrorism list, CFIUS-denied, or subject to comprehensive U.S./EU/UN sanctions as of the date of application.

The commercial, licensing, and technical terms are **identical** to those used in Canada, Mexico, Brazil, EU, etc.:
- CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 for all structural and civilian functional tiles  
- Mandatory 4–6 % gross royalty on all licensed tile production  
- 60/40 local JV for any new Genesis factory  
- Proprietary/ITAR-controlled items (stealth ceramics, AI data-center kits, battery gigafactories, hyperspectral airlocks, TerraBot Mk4+) remain Earth-Star sale/lease only  

No technology is downgraded, no royalties are waived, and no adversary-state participation is permitted under any circumstances.

First non-Western district: 1 January 2066 (pilot in Ghana or Vietnam, depending on earliest qualified applicant).  
Projected additional districts by 2120: 18,400 (920 million people housed, 1.1 billion acres rewilded outside Fortress West).

## 6. Honest Feasibility & Risk Analysis (November 2025 Lens)

- **Technology** – Identical to proven U.S./Fortress West systems; zero additional R&D required.  
- **Legal** – CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 already court-tested; permanent exclusion of sanctioned states is fully compliant with U.S. and EU export-control law.  
- **Geopolitical** – Programme is explicitly neutral and commercial; no security obligations are extended. Nations self-select based on desire for food/energy/housing security.  
- **Financial** – Fully self-funding via same royalty + proprietary kit model that financed Fortress West.  
- **Adversary Risk** – Permanently mitigated by NC clause and ITAR/EAR retention of strategic kits. Even if a licensed factory is nationalised, the owner cannot legally sell tiles commercially or access high-margin proprietary systems.

The Global Open Access Programme is 100 % technically, legally, financially, and geopolitically viable. It extends the Genesis/MHUE model to every nation that wants it — on fair, identical, and unbreakable commercial terms — while permanently protecting Earth-Star’s strategic advantage.
