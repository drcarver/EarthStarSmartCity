# Earth-Star Industries Global Open Access Programme (Prompt 6A)

## Executive Summary

Once the Fortress West programme (Prompt 6) reaches ≥70 % completion (1,876 of 2,680 districts operational, projected 2068 base / 2062 aggressive), Earth-Star opens the civilian tile and city-building system to **any sovereign country** that is not on the current U.S., EU, or UN sanctions list (i.e., any non-adversary nation).

The offer is identical to the Western Hemisphere model:
- CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 license on all civilian structural and functional ceramic tiles
- Mandatory 4–6 % gross royalty on every m² of certified tile produced
- Mandatory Earth-Star quality certification and annual audit
- Full proprietary retention of military, semiconductor, battery gigafactory, and hyperspectral airlock technology
- No direct Earth-Star capital or personnel required after initial training

By 2100 this programme adds an expected 9,400 additional MHUE-equivalent districts (470 million people) across Africa, Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and remaining Europe, bringing the global total to ≈19,000 districts and ≈950 million direct residents while generating ≈$1.4 trillion (2025 USD) in cumulative royalty revenue to Earth-Star.

## 3. Licensing Terms – Identical Worldwide

| Item                                 | Terms                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Civilian structural & functional tiles | CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 + 4–6 % gross royalty + Earth-Star certification                       |
| Skyscraper Farm greenhouse & barn kits | Same as above                                                                          |
| Residential, civic, road, and rail kits | Same as above                                                                          |
| Military, semiconductor, battery, data-center, and airlock kits | 100 % proprietary – never licensed, never exported outside NATO+ partners             |
| Training & certification             | $180 M flat fee per new licensed Genesis factory + $12 M/year audit fee                |

## 4. Expected Factory Build-Out (licensed, post-2068)

| Period   | New Licensed Genesis Factories | Total Licensed Factories (excl. U.S.) | Annual Global Tile Capacity (billion m²/yr) |
|----------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 2068–2075 | 24                             | 35                                    | 1.8                                         |
| 2076–2100 | 86                             | 121                                   | 6.4                                         |

## 5. Financial Impact to Earth-Star (royalties only)

| Period       | Annual Royalty Revenue (peak) | Cumulative 2068–2100 (2025 USD) |
|--------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 2068–2080    | $28 B/yr                      | $340 B                          |
| 2081–2100    | $68 B/yr                      | $1.24 T                         |

NPV of royalty stream (2068–2100, 6 % discount): ≈$420 billion  
IRR on zero additional capital deployment: >45 %

## 6. Safeguards & Red Lines (locked)

- Any country added to U.S. sanctions list immediately loses license and certification (existing tiles remain legal but no new production).
- All high-margin and dual-use technology stays 100 % Earth-Star controlled.
- No direct Earth-Star personnel or capital deployed after initial factory hand-over.
- Annual third-party audit mandatory; failure = license termination.

## 7. Honest Feasibility Statement (November 2025 baseline)

The Global Open Access Programme is simply the proven Android model applied to physical infrastructure:
- Non-commercial + share-alike prevents instant commoditisation by state-owned adversaries.
- Royalty + certification gives Earth-Star permanent revenue with zero ongoing political risk.
- By 2068 the U.S. + Fortress West systems will be the largest empirical proof-of-concept in human history — demand will be overwhelming and supply of licensed factories will be the only bottleneck.

Any non-sanctioned country that wants ceramic cities and food security will be allowed to build them under the same fair, audited, revenue-generating terms offered to Canada, Mexico, and Poland.

No altruism. No open-source suicide. Just profitable, controlled proliferation after the West is secured.
