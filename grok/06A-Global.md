# Earth-Star Industries Part 6A – Controlled Global Licensing Extension  
**“Open Door – Same Deal” Programme (Post-Fortress West)**

## Executive Summary

After **Fortress West** is irreversibly successful (minimum 2,000 international districts fully operational and revenue-positive, achieved 2084 base / 2076 aggressive), Earth-Star opens the **exact same licensing package** offered to NATO/Western Hemisphere partners to **any sovereign country on Earth** that meets five non-negotiable conditions.

This is **not charity, not open-source, and not reckless proliferation**.  
It is the controlled, high-margin, geopolitically neutral monetisation of the most valuable construction system ever invented.

**First non-Western country district:** 2 January 2085 (base) / 2077 (aggressive)  
**Final global total by 2150:** 21,400 districts (4,180 U.S. + 2,680 Fortress West + **14,540 rest-of-world**)  
**Additional population served:** 1.16 billion  
**Additional acres rewilded:** 1.42 billion  
**Earth-Star cumulative royalty + proprietary revenue 2045–2150:** **$41.6 trillion (2025 USD)**  
**IRR on global licensing 2045–2150:** **16.3 %**

The deal is identical, word-for-word, with Canada or Chile — because the contract was designed from day one to be country-agnostic and bulletproof.

## The Five Non-Negotiable Conditions (Locked 2044 Licensing Template)

Any country wishing to build MHUE-class districts must publicly sign the standard Earth-Star Master License Agreement containing exactly these clauses (no exceptions, no side letters):

| Condition                                                                 | Enforcement Mechanism                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. 5 % gross royalty on every m² of Genesis-family tile produced or used | Audited annually by Earth-Star appointed Big-4 firm     |
| 2. Mandatory 60/40 local JV for every new Genesis factory | Earth-Star appoints Chairman + veto on technology      |
| 3. Full purchase of proprietary kits (AI data center, battery gigafactory, smart airlock) at list price | ITAR-style export control retained by Earth-Star        |
| 4. No reverse-engineering or independent production of stealth ceramics | Immediate license termination + $10 B penalty clause   |
| 5. Districts must achieve ≥90 % material closure using local waste within 10 years | Independent verification or royalty doubles to 10 %     |

Countries that sign get the full catalogue, training, and ongoing upgrades.  
Countries that refuse or cheat get nothing — forever.

| India                          | 2085           | 4,800                   | 384            | 7                    | Fastest adopter |

## Financial Impact to Earth-Star (2085–2150 only)

| Item                                    | Revenue (2025 $T) |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 5 % royalty on 1.42 billion additional people | 28.4              |
| Proprietary kit sales (data centers, batteries, airlocks) | 11.8          |
| JV factory equity returns               | 1.4               |
| **Total additional revenue**            | **41.6**          |

Zero additional CapEx for Earth-Star — pure licensing cash flow.

## Honest Feasibility Statement (2025 Lens)

Every country that wants food security, construction cost collapse, and energy independence will eventually sign — because by 2085 the alternative is paying 6× more to build with 2025 technology while their neighbours pay 1/6th.

The five conditions are deliberately designed to be painful enough to prevent trivial copying, but rational enough that no sovereign state can credibly refuse once the system is proven at scale.

This is the controlled, profitable, and permanent export of the most powerful construction technology of the 21st–22nd century — on exactly Earth-Star’s terms.
