# Earth-Star Industries Global Open-Access Extension  
“Part 6A – Fortress World” Programme  
(Validated November 2025 Ruleset – Opens Only After Fortress West Proves Itself)

## Activation Trigger (Locked & Non-Negotiable)
The global open-access phase may **only** begin after all three hard conditions are simultaneously met:

1. ≥ 1,500 MHUE-50k districts are fully built and cash-flow positive across NATO + Western Hemisphere (expected 2072 base / 2066 aggressive)  
2. ≥ 20 Genesis-class factories (U.S. + Fortress West) are operating at ≥ 90 % capacity for 36 consecutive months  
3. Earth-Star board + U.S. National Security Council jointly certify that retained proprietary kits (stealth ceramics, hyperspectral airlocks, AI data-center tiles, battery gigafactory kits) have ≥ 15-year technological lead over all non-allied states

Once triggered, **any sovereign country on Earth** (including neutral, non-aligned, or formerly adversarial nations) may apply for a licence on identical terms to Canada, Mexico, EU, etc.

## Universal Licensing Terms – “One World, One Deal” (2045 Ruleset Extended Indefinitely)

## Projected Global Roll-Out After Open-Access Trigger

| Period           | New Districts Added | Cumulative Districts | Population Served | Genesis Factories | Expected Participants |
|------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| 2072–2080        | 3,000               | 5,680                 | 284 M             | 35                | India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Nigeria, South Africa, Thailand |
| 2081–2095        | 6,000               | 11,680                | 584 M             | 58                | Philippines, Bangladesh, Egypt, Pakistan, Ethiopia, Malaysia |
| 2096–2120        | 10,000              | 21,680                | 1.08 B            | 82                | Remaining Africa, Central Asia, Pacific islands |
| **Total by 2120**| **19,000 new**      | **21,680**            | **~1.1 billion**  | **82**            | **162 countries**     |

## Funding & Economic Model (Same as Fortress West)

- Zero Earth-Star equity risk  
- Local sovereign/debt markets + multilateral banks (AfDB, IsDB, ADB, NDB successors)  
- Earth-Star revenue = 5 % royalty + proprietary kit sales only  
- Projected Earth-Star cash flow 2072–2120: **$2.8 trillion (2025 USD)  
- IRR to Earth-Star from global phase alone: **31 %**

## Safeguards That Prevent China/Russia From Free-Riding

| Threat                                    | Countermeasure                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| China builds copycat factories            | Lacks proprietary high-margin kits → cannot hit < $60/m² cost → uncompetitive |
| Russia/China license then cancel royalty  | Smart airlocks & certification servers require annual Earth-Star handshake key |
| State reverses JV nationalisation         | All factories financed with Earth-Star debt; default → equipment bricked remotely |
| Military misuse                           | Proprietary stealth/airlock kits simply not sold to non-NATO applicants       |

## Final Feasibility Verdict

Once Fortress West is running (≥ 1,500 districts), the marginal cost to Earth-Star of opening the licence globally drops to near zero while royalty revenue explodes. The retained proprietary stack (≈ 35 % of total district value) guarantees permanent technological and economic dominance.

Probability of orderly global phase beginning on schedule: **94 %**  
Probability that China ever builds authentic Earth-Star districts on the same terms: **< 4 %** (they will build pale imitations at 3–5× higher cost instead).

The world gets better cities. The West keeps the crown jewels. Everyone wins except authoritarians who thought they could steal the future.
