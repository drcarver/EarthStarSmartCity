# Earth-Star Industries Global Open-Access Programme  
**Prompt 6A – “Open Cities” (Post-Fortress West Extension)**  
**First non-Western-Hemisphere / non-NATO district groundbreaking:** 2 January 2072  
(locked hard gate – only after Fortress West Phase 3 is ≥70 % complete and ≥1,000 total districts are revenue-positive)

## Core Mission
After the defensive “Fortress West” bloc is irreversibly established and cash-flowing at continental scale, Earth-Star will open the proven MHUE-50k / Skyscraper Farm system to any sovereign nation on Earth that meets four non-negotiable conditions:

1. Signs the 2070 Earth-Star Global Licence Agreement (identical commercial terms as Fortress West)  
2. Accepts the permanent NC/SA clause (no military use, no transfer to sanctioned entities)  
3. Pays the same 4–6 % gross royalty in USD or USD-equivalent  
4. Allows Earth-Star final quality-certification authority on all load-bearing ceramic kits

No geopolitical veto beyond existing U.S. export-control lists.  
China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela remain permanently excluded under ITAR / BIS rules.

All other 140+ countries are eligible immediately upon signature.

## 3. Genesis Factory Licensing Plan (38 additional plants)

- All follow identical 60/40 JV + 4–6 % royalty model  
- Earth-Star retains golden-share veto on any military diversion  
- Typical partners: Adani (India), Dangote (Nigeria), Astra (Indonesia), Koç (Turkey), etc.

## 4. Licensing Terms – Identical Worldwide (2072 onward)

| Item                                      | License Type            | Royalty | Military Use Allowed? |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------|-----------------------|
| Standard & functional ceramic tiles       | CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0         | 4–6 % gross | No                    |
| Skyscraper Farm kits                      | CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0          | 4 % gross | No                    |
| Smart-road, HSR slab, residential pods    | CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0         | 5 % gross | No                    |
| Stealth ceramics, hyperspectral airlocks, AI data-center kits, gigafactory kits | Permanently withheld | 100 % proprietary / ITAR | —       | —                     |

## 5. Funding Realism (Open Cities)

| Source                                      | % of CapEx | Notes |
|---------------------------------------------|------------|-------|
| Host-country sovereign debt & budgets       | 44 %       | Same as Fortress West |
| Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank / NDB  | 18 %       | Already exist 2025 |
| Islamic Development Bank + Gulf SWFs        | 16 %       | Proven infra investors |
| African Development Bank + China Exim alternative (non-Chinese) | 12 %   | |
| Earth-Star royalties + parent cash sweep    | 10 %       | Reinvested U.S. profits |

No charity, no grants, no fantasy global fund.

## 6. Programme Cash-Flow to Earth-Star (royalty-only, USD trillions, 2025)

| Decade   | Districts Online (cum.) | Annual Royalty | Cumulative Royalty |
|----------|--------------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| 2072–79  | 1,800                    | 0.09           | 0.72               |
| 2080–89  | 5,000                    | 0.24           | 2.64               |
| 2090–99  | 7,100                    | 0.36           | 5.88               |
| 2100–50  | 9,400                    | 0.48           | 19+                |

Pure royalty cash flow, zero CapEx risk to Earth-Star after 2072.

## 7. Final Proprietary Firewall (Never Released)

- All stealth / radar-absorbing ceramics  
- Hyperspectral weapon/explosive airlocks  
- AI data-center DC-native server & cooling kits  
- LFP/Na-ion & next-gen solid-state battery process kits  
- TerraBot™ Mk4+ controller source code  
- All nuclear-related ceramic shielding

Everything else is licensed under NC/SA.

## 8. Aggressive but 100 % Honest Feasibility Verdict (November 2025 view)

- Starts only after Fortress West is an unassailable economic & military fact (2072)  
- Uses exactly the same contract template proven in 2,680 Western districts  
- Royalty-only model means Earth-Star bears zero construction, political, or currency risk  
- NC/SA clause legally prevents reverse-engineering into military applications by non-allies  
- Demand will be overwhelming: every country not on the sanctioned list will queue once India & Nigeria are seen succeeding  
- No new technology required — pure licensing scale-out of 2040s-proven system

**Conclusion**  
Prompt 6A “Open Cities” is not charity and not open-source suicide.  
It is the controlled, profitable, and geopolitically safe globalisation of the most valuable construction system ever created — while permanently ring-fencing every technology that actually matters for Western strategic superiority.

Earth-Star makes >$5 trillion in pure royalty profit and brings modern housing, food, and energy to ~470 million additional humans — all without spending a single dollar of its own after 2072.

**Recommendation:**  
Keep the gate closed until 2072.  
Then open it wide — on our terms.
