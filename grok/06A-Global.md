# Prompt 6A – “Open Door” Global Extension  
**First Non-Fortress-West District Groundbreaking: 2 January 2072**  
**(Locked – only after minimum 2,000 Fortress West districts are revenue-positive and 9 of 11 licensed Genesis factories have >10 years flawless operation)**

## Core Principle
Any sovereign nation on Earth – regardless of ideology, religion, or prior relations – may license the full MHUE-50k / Skyscraper Farm system on exactly the same financial, legal, and technical terms as Canada, Brazil, Germany, or Poland.

No discounts. No waivers. No bilateral deals.

## Executive Summary – Global Open Door (2072–2150)

## Global Genesis Factory Build-Out Beyond Fortress West (42 additional)

| Region Example            | Factories | First Online | Notes |
|---------------------------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| India (3 sites)           | 3         | 2073–2077    | Adani / Reliance JVs |
| Southeast Asia            | 5         | 2075–2082    | Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam |
| Africa                    | 12        | 2078–2095    | Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, Morocco, South Africa |
| Middle East               | 4         | 2080–2088    | Saudi, UAE, Türkiye |
| Rest of world             | 18        | 2085–2110    |       |

Total worldwide Genesis capacity by 2110: 53 factories × 30 M m²/yr = 1.59 billion m²/yr

## Funding & Revenue to Earth-Star (2072–2150)

| Source                              | Amount (2025 USD) |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Royalty stream (5.4 % average)      | $8.1 trillion     |
| Proprietary kit sales (TerraFab™, AI DC, airlocks)| $1.3 trillion |
| **Total cash to Earth-Star**        | **$9.4 trillion** |

Earth-Star becomes permanently self-funding from global royalties by 2078.

## Strict Red Lines – Non-Negotiable

| Condition                                  | Consequence                     |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Transfer of proprietary components to sanctioned entities| Immediate global license termination |
| Failure to pay royalties 2 consecutive years| Factory shutdown + asset seizure |
| Attempted reverse-engineering of TerraFab™ or stealth tiles| Permanent ban + ICC damages claim |
| Use of districts for military purposes without Earth-Star consent| Contract void + embargo |

## Honest Global Feasibility Verdict (November 2025)

- The “Open Door” terms are deliberately identical to Fortress West because discrimination would be geopolitically unsustainable after 2070.  
- By 2072 the technology is so proven, so cheap at margin, and so environmentally dominant that no sovereign government can credibly refuse its own citizens access.  
- Royalty + proprietary component sales generate more cash for Earth-Star than the entire U.S. GDP for decades.  
- Non-proliferation controls are stronger than the Missile Technology Control Regime because the economic penalty for violation is instant and total.  
- Zero technical or financial reason exists to withhold the civilian system once the West is secure.

**Any country that can fog a mirror and pay its bills gets the cities.
