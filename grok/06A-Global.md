# Open Horizon – Global Open Access Programme (Prompt 6A)

## Executive Summary

Upon achievement of **500 operational MHUE-equivalent districts** in NATO + Western Hemisphere countries (trigger year 2063 base / 2059 aggressive), Earth-Star Industries will open the Genesis ceramic tile/kit ecosystem to **any sovereign nation** that meets minimal non-adversarial criteria on identical commercial terms to the Americas programme.

**Core Principle:**  
Same deal as Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, Poland, Chile — no better, no worse.

**Projected Outcome (2100 base / 2090 aggressive):**
- Additional 8,820 MHUE-equivalent districts outside Fortress West
- Total global districts: 11,500+ (575 million residents)
- Additional 1.42 billion acres rewilded
- 38 new licensed Genesis factories (60/40 JV)
- Cumulative royalty + proprietary kit revenue to Earth-Star: $42.8 trillion (2025 USD)
- NPV (2063–2120 @ 6 %): $96.4 trillion
- IRR to Earth-Star: 36 %

Stealth ceramics, AI data-center kits, battery gigafactory kits, and smart airlocks remain 100 % proprietary and export-controlled forever.

| Payment currency                    | USD or gold-backed stablecoin                           |

## 3. Projected Deployment by Major Region (2100 total)

| Region                     | Districts | Population (M) | Licensed Factories | Acres Rewilded (M) |
|----------------------------|-----------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| India                      | 2,800     | 140            | 9                  | 410                |
| Southeast Asia (ASEAN)     | 1,820     | 91             | 7                  | 280                |

## 4. Funding Stack (identical to Fortress West)

| Source                          | % of CapEx |
|---------------------------------|------------|
| National development banks      | 40 %       |
| ADB / AfDB / IsDB / NDB loans   | 28 %       |
| Sovereign wealth / pension funds| 18 %       |
| Earth-Star royalty financing    | 10 %       |
| Local private                   | 4 %        |

Zero reliance on non-existent global funds.

## 5. Proprietary vs Licensed Kits (unchanged)

**Forever Proprietary (Earth-Star only):**
- Stealth radar-absorbing ceramics
- AI data-center flat-pack systems
- LFP/Na-ion gigafactory modules
- Smart airlock + hyperspectral threat detection
- 3 nm TerraFab core toolkits

**Licensed Globally (CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 + royalty):**
- All structural, BIPV, AWG, rainscreen tiles
- Residential, hospital, school, farm, HSR kits
- DC appliance lines

## 6. Financial Impact to Earth-Star (2063–2120)

| Revenue Stream                  | Cumulative (2025 $T) |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|
| Tile & civilian kit royalties   | 18.4                 |
| Proprietary high-margin kits    | 24.4                 |
| **Total**                       | **42.8**             |

**NPV (2063–2120 @ 6 %):** $96.4 trillion  
**IRR:** 36 %

## 7. Honest Feasibility & Safeguards (November 2025 baseline)

**Why it works:**
- Identical commercial terms as proven Fortress West partners
- Trigger only after 500+ districts are profitable → zero technology risk
- Mandatory 60/40 JV + royalty prevents free-riding
- Proprietary retention on dual-use and highest-margin tech
- No charitable handouts, no open-source structural tiles

**Realpolitik safeguards:**
- Export license revocable unilaterally by Earth-Star for national security
- All factories include remote kiln-disable switch (encrypted)
- Royalty payments auto-suspend on sanctions list addition
- Stealth & AI kits never leave U.S./NATO-allied control

**Conclusion:** Open Horizon is the logical, profitable, and geopolitically safe extension of the proven Fortress West model to every non-adversarial country on Earth — on exactly the same commercial terms, with zero compromise on critical technology or revenue.
