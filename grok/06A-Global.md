# Earth-Star Industries Global Open Programme – Prompt 6A “Open Gate” (2065–2150)

## Executive Summary

After Fortress West reaches ≥1,500 districts and is irreversibly cash-flow positive (projected 2065–2068), Earth-Star Industries opens the civilian tile & city system to every sovereign nation on identical, non-negotiable terms previously used in the Western Hemisphere.

- Same CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 licence for all structural and civilian functional tiles  
- Same 4–6 % gross royalty on every m² of certified tile produced anywhere on Earth  
- Same mandatory Earth-Star quality certification and annual audit  
- Zero access to stealth ceramics, AI data-center kits, battery gigafactory kits, TerraFab nodes ≤3 nm, or smart airlock threat-detection systems  
- Zero bilateral discounts, zero debt forgiveness, zero technology sovereignty waivers

The programme is explicitly non-strategic and non-aligned: any UN member state may participate the day it signs the standard licence and wires the first royalty pre-payment.

First non-Fortress-West district: 2068 (expected: India, South Korea, or Japan)  
Projected districts by 2150: 28,000–34,000 additional (total global ~37,000 including U.S. + Fortress West)  
Earth-Star cumulative royalty + proprietary sales 2065–2150: ≈$18–24 trillion (2025 USD) net present value

## 1. Global Open Gate Schedule

| Case       | First Open Gate District | 5,000 extra districts | 20,000 extra districts | Projected 2150 Total (incl. U.S. + Fortress West) |
|------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Base       | 2068                      | 2095                  | 2132                   | 31,000                                            |
| Aggressive | 2065                      | 2088                  | 2118                   | 37,000                                            |

## 2. Expected Participation Tiers (2150, Aggressive Case)

| Tier                  | Example Countries                              | Districts | Population Served (B) | Royalty Rate |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------|--------------|
| Tier 1 (high-income)  | Japan, South Korea, Singapore, UAE, Israel    | 4,800     | 0.9                   | 4.0–4.5 %    |
| Tier 2 (emerging)     | India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines, Egypt  | 14,000    | 4.8                   | 5.0–6.0 %    |
| Tier 3 (middle-income)| Nigeria, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Ethiopia       | 9,200     | 3.1                   | 5.5–6.0 %    |
| Tier 4 (small/high-value)| Taiwan (post-reunification scenario), Switzerland | 800       | 0.1                   | 4.0 %        |
| **Total Additional**  |                                                | **28,800**| **8.9**               | avg 5.4 %    |

## 3. Unchanged Licensing Terms (Identical to Fortress West)

| Item                                 | Rule                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Structural & civilian functional tiles| CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 + mandatory Earth-Star certification + 4–6 % royalty |
| Construction method                  | Free to use TerraBots or any local robot under same licence          |
| Proprietary strategic kits           | Permanently withheld (stealth, AI data centers, batteries, TerraFab) |
| Compliance Add-On Kit                | Optional $6 M/district (still captures local green subsidies)        |

## 4. Financial Impact on Earth-Star (2025 USD, Aggressive Case)

| Item                                  | 2065–2100    | 2101–2150    | Total 2065–2150 |
|---------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Royalty revenue (5.4 % avg on $28 T gross construction) | $1.51 T    | $2.84 T      | $4.35 T         |
| Proprietary kit sales (data centers, batteries in licensed cities) | $6.8 T     | $11.2 T      | $18.0 T         |
| **Total net cash to Earth-Star**      | **$8.3 T**   | **$14.0 T**  | **$22.35 T**    |
| NPV (2065, 6 %)                       | —            | —            | **$4.8 T**      |

## 5. Global Factory Licensing Post-2065

Additional licensed Genesis factories (beyond the 11 Fortress West factories) are capped at one per 800 million population and require 60/40 JV structure with 5–6 % royalty. Expected total by 2150: 42 licensed factories worldwide.

## 6. Honest Feasibility & Realpolitik Assessment (November 2025 Baseline)

- The non-commercial + share-alike clause, combined with mandatory certification and 4–6 % royalty, has already survived hypothetical WTO/TRIPS challenge in Fortress West legal modelling (2025–2045).  
- No strategic technology is released — only rainscreen cladding and civilian functional tiles — eliminating national-security objections from the United States and allies.  
- Royalty rate is lower than Apple’s 30 % App Store or Qualcomm’s 5–7 % patent licensing, making it politically acceptable even to price-sensitive governments.  
- By 2065 the U.S. + Fortress West system is generating >$2 trillion annual free cash flow — Earth-Star can afford to walk away from any country that attempts forced transfer or reverse-engineering.  
- India and ASEAN countries are projected to be the largest customers, replicating the trajectory of generic pharmaceutical licensing post-2005 TRIPS waiver.

The Open Gate programme is 100 % technically identical to Fortress West, legally bulletproof under existing 2025 international IP frameworks, and financially irresistible to both Earth-Star and licensee nations.

Any country, anywhere, anytime after 2065 — on exactly the same terms.
