# TerraWell FreeCare System: Detailed Specification (December 2025)

## 1. Executive Summary

The TerraWell FreeCare System, operated by the independent TerraWell Foundation as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, provides free humanitarian aid through the distribution of donated tangible goods and on-site medical services to underserved populations. Its mission is to alleviate hunger, improve health access, and support disaster recovery without accepting public funds, relying solely on fair-market-value donations from EarthStar Technologies. By 2050, the system aims to operate 500 fixed centers and 1,000 mobile units nationwide, serving 50 million individuals annually with food, OTC medications, generic drugs (where compliant), and durable medical equipment (DME). This structure ensures strict separation from EarthStar's for-profit Genesis System, with all transactions at arm's length. Net financial impact to EarthStar includes enhanced tax deductions under IRC §170(e)(3) for qualifying inventory (e.g., food at cost + 50% profit, up to 2x cost), potentially yielding $500M–$1B in annual savings post-2035, subject to the new 1% floor on corporate deductions effective after 2025. Humanitarian impact focuses on equitable access, with no recipient requirements, fostering community resilience.

## 2. Legal & Tax Structure Description

The TerraWell Foundation is a standalone 501(c)(3) public charity, exempt under IRC §501(c)(3) for charitable, educational, and scientific purposes, with a focus on health and welfare. It maintains an independent board of directors (no overlapping members with EarthStar), separate bank accounts, and distinct operations to prevent private inurement or undue influence. All donations from EarthStar are tangible inventory only, valued at fair market value (FMV) per IRS Publication 561, with EarthStar claiming deductions under IRC §170(e)(3) for qualifying contributions to the needy or ill (e.g., food and certain medical supplies). Deductions are limited to 10% of taxable income (with 5-year carryover), subject to a 1% floor for years beginning after December 31, 2025. Arm's-length transactions ensure FMV appraisals by independent experts. No services, cash, or intellectual property are donated. FDA compliance requires donated drugs to be unexpired, properly stored, and FDA-approved; DME must meet Class I/II device standards without modifications. The foundation funds operations through general donations and volunteer efforts, avoiding unrelated business taxable income (UBTI) by limiting activities to mission-aligned services.

## 5. Rollout Timeline 2027–2075

- **2027–2030 (Pilot Phase)**: Establish foundation; secure 501(c)(3) status. Launch 5 fixed centers and 10 mobile units in high-need areas (e.g., urban food deserts). Initial donations: food/OTC only.
- **2031–2040 (Expansion)**: Scale to 100 centers/200 mobiles; add generics/DME post-FDA compliance audits. Focus on rural/underserved regions.
