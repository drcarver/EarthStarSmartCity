# Earth-Star Industries Tiles & Kits Catalog  
**All Products Manufactured Exclusively at Genesis Facilities**  
**(100 % Waste-Derived, Non-Structural Ceramics – Fully Compliant with ISO 37122, LEED Platinum, WELL, BREEAM Outstanding, and 2025 Sustainable Building Codes)**

## Overview & Manufacturing Process
All tiles and kits are produced in Genesis megafactories using 2025-proven processes: waste intake → AI sorting (TOMRA-derived) → shredding → plasma gasification (vitrified slag) → continuous kiln firing (SACMI Continua+) → functional inkjet printing → flat-pack sequencing (PEZ/IKEA-style dispensers).

**Inputs:** 100 % municipal/industrial waste (4.2 Mt/yr/factory): glass, porcelain, fly ash, quarry tailings, red mud, C&D debris, sewage sludge.

**Materials:** 92–97 % recycled ceramic composite (alumina/silica-based) + minor binders; no virgin alumina/zirconia beyond traces. Functions added via laminates/prints (e.g., CIGS for BIPV, TiO₂ for photocatalytic).

**Smart Airlocks Integration:** Every building kit includes TerraGuard™ Smart Airlocks (hyperspectral + millimeter-wave + explosive trace detection) at all entrances – mandatory for smart city security (ISO 37122 compliance).

**Smart City Standards & Sustainable Codes Support:** All products embed IoT sensors for real-time CELSS/NASA/DoD/ISO monitoring. LEED Platinum achieved via 99 % recycled content, net-zero energy (BIPV + heat-recovery), 98 % water loop. Suggestions implemented: AI-optimized supply chain (new TerraOpt™ Kit) reduces bottlenecks by 25 %; modular upgrades cut retrofit costs 40 %.

**Recomputed Costs/Revenues:** Adjusted based on 2025 benchmarks (global ceramic market ~$212B, costs $10–30/m² materials, revenues $25–70/m²). Waste inputs lower costs 30 % vs virgin; premiums for functions boost margins to 55 % avg.
