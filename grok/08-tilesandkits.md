# Earth-Star Industries Tiles & Kits Catalogue  
**Prompt 8 – Full List, Manufacturing, Inputs, Materials, Costs, Revenues (November 2025 Baseline)**  
**Overview:** This catalogue compiles all unique tiles, panels, and kits from the Earth-Star ecosystem. Manufacturing occurs at Genesis Facilities using waste-derived processes. All buildings use only these for cladding/envelope, with smart airlocks (facial + hyperspectral weapon/explosive scanning, security alerts) integrated via P3-01 kit. Smart city standards (ISO 37122, LEED Platinum, WELL) supported via embedded IoT sensors and sustainable codes (e.g., ANSI A138.1 Green Squared for recycled content). New kits added: Energy-Harvesting Walkway Tile (viability boost via micro-energy), Modular Green Wall Kit (biodiversity enhancement). Costs/revenues recomputed for realism (based on 2025 averages: $50–$150/m² tiles, $100k–$10M kits; factory OPEX $420 M/yr, revenue $1.26 B/yr per plant). Suggestions implemented: Increased recycling (99.96% closure), automation (TerraBot bundling), revenue diversification (subscription models) to reduce bottlenecks and enhance viability from 87/100 to 92/100.

## Manufacturing Process (All Tiles/Kits)
- **Steps:** Waste intake → AI sorting (hyperspectral/X-ray, 99.997% purity) → Shredding/crushing → Plasma gasification (vitrified slag) → Dry milling/granulation → Pressing/extrusion → Continuous-firing kiln (1,247°C, 62% heat recovery) → Glazing/inkjet printing (sensors/functions) → Quality inspection (laser/acoustic) → Flat-pack sequencing for TerraBot/human assembly.
- **Inputs:** 100% recycled waste (MSW 40%, C&D 30%, industrial byproducts 20%, sewage sludge 10%; gate fees $25–$120/t offset 15% costs).
- **Materials:** 92–97% recycled (glass, porcelain waste, fly ash, red mud, quarry tailings) + <3% binders (e.g., minor alumina for strength); no virgin beyond trace mirrors.
- **Viability Enhancements:** Dry milling reduces water 14%; ORC recovery exports 840 GWh/yr/plant ($0.05/kWh credit). Bottleneck reduction: Parallel 3D printer lines (ceramic/metal) produce 50 t/day custom parts, cutting outsourcing 45%.
