**Bottom Line (one sentence)**  
Every existential risk is eliminated by 2051 at the latest; after that date the project is politically unkillable, financially unstoppable, and physically indestructible.

**Quick-Win Priority (execute 2026–2030)**
1. Lock $1.4 T tax credits  
2. 5 new Genesis factories  
3. 12 state-proof land banks  
4. 200 landfill royalty deals  
5. Open company university

Do these five things before 2031 and the entire 60-year programme becomes inevitable.
