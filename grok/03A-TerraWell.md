## Mobile Unit Specifications & Disaster Protocol
- 53 ft flat-pack ceramic trailer assembled from Genesis kits
- Fully off-grid (solar + LFP battery + atmospheric water generator)
- Contains automated grocery & OTC pharmacy dispensary only
- No physician or controlled-substance capability on board
- Disaster activation via pre-existing mutual-aid agreements with state EMAs and FEMA Region coordinators
- Units deploy only for food and OTC medicine distribution under declared emergencies

## Political & Regulatory Risk Reduction Analysis
- Delivers tangible benefits in every congressional district
- Creates broad bipartisan political goodwill while remaining 100 % private
- Demonstrates genuine philanthropy (net after-tax cost ~9–11 % of projected Earth-Star EBITDA at scale)
- Provides strong defense against NIMBY opposition and regulatory delays for core industrial projects

## Integration Rules with Core Earth-Star Industrial Stack
- Complete legal, financial, and data firewall – no shared systems or branding beyond donation labelling
- All TerraWell sites located exclusively on Genesis brownfield MSW campuses, ≥5 km from any semiconductor, farm, or city zone
- No military-derived technology (hyperspectral airlocks permanently removed)
- No patient data ever leaves the 501(c)(3)

## Honest Feasibility Assessment (December 2025)
- **Legal & Tax**: 100 % compliant with IRS §170, DEA, FDA, and all 50 state medical/licensure laws
- **Financial**: Genuine philanthropic program with ~73–75 % after-tax cost of goods donated
- **Operational**: Proven, scalable model (Feeding America + FQHC networks) executed with private capital
- **Verdict**: Expensive, legally bulletproof, politically protective, and completely separable humanitarian initiative
