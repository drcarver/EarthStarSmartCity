# TerraWell FreeCare System  
**Authoritative Final Specification – Version 3.0**  
**All prior Prompt 03A visions, 30 November 2025 Addendum claims, and any earlier statements are permanently superseded**  
**First centers & mobile units operational:** Q1 2035

## Core Mission (Corrected & Locked)
Operate a nationwide 501(c)(3) nonprofit (TerraWell Foundation) that provides **free** food, OTC/generic non-scheduled medications, and basic FDA-cleared durable medical equipment to the public on a first-come, first-served basis, funded exclusively by fair-market-value donations of tangible goods from Earth-Star Industries (for-profit).  

The program is designed to:
- Deliver genuine philanthropic benefit
- Generate legitimate, IRS-compliant tax deductions
- Build grassroots political goodwill
- Remain 100 % legally and operationally separate from all for-profit Earth-Star activities

## Legal & Tax Structure (Text Description)
- TerraWell Foundation is an independent IRC §501(c)(3) public charity (not private foundation).
- Board composition: maximum 33 % Earth-Star-affiliated directors; majority independent.
- Independent compensation, valuation, and governance committees required.
- All donations are tangible goods only (food, OTC meds, FDA-cleared/510(k)-exempt medical equipment).
- Valuation: independent third-party appraisals annually; deductions capped at the enhanced inventory rule (cost + 50 % of appreciation, never exceeding 2 × cost).
- No deduction allowed for physician services, clinic visits, therapy sessions, or mobile-unit operating time.
- Annual independent audit and full public Form 990 disclosure.

Program remains a genuine net philanthropic expense (≈47 % of production cost after tax benefit).

## Mobile Unit Specifications & Disaster Response Protocols
- 40 ft ceramic-composite trailer, off-grid capable (solar + battery).
- Stock: 90-day supply of food baskets, OTC meds, basic DME.
- Staffing: 1 nurse practitioner + 2 medical assistants (1099 contractors).
- Disaster protocol: pre-positioning agreements with FEMA Region coordinators; units deploy within 48 hours of declared emergency; services limited to tangible-goods distribution only.

## Political Risk Reduction Analysis
- Demonstrates visible corporate social responsibility at scale.
- Serves 18–22 % of U.S. population by 2075 → broad geographic and demographic support base.
- Independent 501(c)(3) structure insulates for-profit operations from regulatory backlash.
- Still requires ongoing philanthropic commitment; not a profit center.

## Integration Rules with Core Earth-Star Industrial Stack
- Complete legal, financial, and data firewall.
- No shared facilities, utilities, or branding beyond “donated by Earth-Star Industries.”
- TerraWell centers built only on separately titled brownfield parcels adjacent to (but not inside) Genesis sites.
- No patient data ever shared with for-profit entities.
