# TerraWell FreeCare System: Executive Summary & Operating Plan  
**“Everything Free, Everything Deductible” – First Centers Open Q1 2035**

## Executive Summary

TerraWell Foundation is a standalone 501(c)(3) public charity that provides unlimited free food, generic/OTC medicines, medical devices, urgent care, primary care, mental health services, and mobile disaster response to every U.S. citizen with zero cost, zero co-pays, zero means testing, and zero government funding.  
All assets and services are donated at independently appraised fair-market value (FMV) by Earth-Star Industries (the for-profit parent). Donations generate massive charitable contribution deductions under IRC §170 that, after 2042, render the entire program cash-flow positive to Earth-Star while building unbreakable grassroots political protection.

First 50 fixed centers and 100 mobile units launch Q1 2035 on Genesis brownfield sites.  
By 2050 the system will serve 120 million Americans annually at zero charge using only private donations and tax savings.

All facilities are built exclusively with Genesis ceramic flat-pack kits and operated under strict legal, physical, and data firewalls from the for-profit stack.

## 1. Legal & Tax Structure (Text Description)

- Earth-Star Industries, Inc. (C-corp) → donates goods and services at FMV to → TerraWell Foundation (independent 501(c)(3) with separate EIN, board, bank accounts, and facilities).
- No shared employees, no data interchange, no joint marketing, no reimbursement agreements.
- Independent appraisal firm (Duff & Phelps or equivalent) performs annual IRS-compliant Form 8283 valuations.
- Earth-Star receives charitable deduction of full FMV in year of donation (limited to 10 % of taxable income with 5-year carryforward).
- Excess deductions carried forward offset future Earth-Star profits, creating permanent tax shield.
- TerraWell Foundation files separate Form 990; audited annually; zero inurement to Earth-Star.
