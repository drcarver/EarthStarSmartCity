# TerraWell FreeCare System: Executive Summary & Operating Plan  
**“Everything Free, Everything Deductible” – First Centers Open Q1 2035**

## Executive Summary

TerraWell Foundation is a standalone 501(c)(3) public charity that provides unlimited free food, generic/OTC medicines, medical devices, urgent care, primary care, mental health services, and mobile disaster response to every U.S. citizen with zero cost, zero co-pays, zero means testing, and zero government funding.  
All assets and services are donated at independently appraised fair-market value (FMV) by Earth-Star Industries (the for-profit parent). Donations generate massive charitable contribution deductions under IRC §170 that, after 2042, render the entire program cash-flow positive to Earth-Star while building unbreakable grassroots political protection.

First 50 fixed centers and 100 mobile units launch Q1 2035 on Genesis brownfield sites.  
By 2050 the system will serve 120 million Americans annually at zero charge using only private donations and tax savings.

All facilities are built exclusively with Genesis ceramic flat-pack kits and operated under strict legal, physical, and data firewalls from the for-profit stack.

## 1. Legal & Tax Structure (Text Description)

- Earth-Star Industries, Inc. (C-corp) → donates goods and services at FMV to → TerraWell Foundation (independent 501(c)(3) with separate EIN, board, bank accounts, and facilities).
- No shared employees, no data interchange, no joint marketing, no reimbursement agreements.
- Independent appraisal firm (Duff & Phelps or equivalent) performs annual IRS-compliant Form 8283 valuations.
- Earth-Star receives charitable deduction of full FMV in year of donation (limited to 10 % of taxable income with 5-year carryforward).
- Excess deductions carried forward offset future Earth-Star profits, creating permanent tax shield.
- TerraWell Foundation files separate Form 990; audited annually; zero inurement to Earth-Star.

## 6. Integration Rules with Core Earth-Star Industrial Stack

- Zero physical co-location with Genesis factories, Skyscraper Farms, TerraFabs, or MHUE cities.
- All TerraWell sites built only on separate parcels within Genesis brownfield MSW-processing zones.
- No shared utilities, no shared personnel, no shared data networks.
- No branding linkage beyond “Donated by Earth-Star Industries” sticker required for FMV appraisal.

All services remain 100 % free in perpetuity. No exceptions ever.

## Identified Remaining Critical Discrepancies

| # | Claim (Original or Nov 2025 Addendum)                                 | Contradiction / 2025–2035 Legal or Operational Reality                                                                                  | Severity  |
|---|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | “Zero cost to recipients – no co-pays, no means testing, no government IDs required” | Providing unlimited free physician visits, psychiatry, and scheduled-drug dispensing without any ID or eligibility check violates federal and state fraud/abuse laws, DEA regulations, and medical-board rules. Free clinics must document identity and medical necessity. | Critical  |
| 2 | Mental health therapy includes “ketamine/psilocybin (when legal)”     | Ketamine and psilocybin are Schedule I/III (ketamine) or Schedule I (psilocybin) at federal level. A 501(c)(3) cannot dispense Schedule I substances outside FDA-approved trials, and ketamine clinics require DEA registration and strict patient tracking. | Critical  |
| 3 | “Primary care annual unlimited” + “urgent care visit” at zero charge | Unlimited free physician services triggers IRS private-benefit doctrine and state corporate-practice-of-medicine prohibitions if physicians are employed directly by the nonprofit without fair-market compensation controls. | Critical  |
| 4 | Mobile units valued at “$1.6 M/month” for deduction                    | IRS only allows deduction for tangible property donated, not for the value of services rendered by a mobile clinic. The trailer itself is deductible once; operating months are not. | Critical  |
| 5 | All facilities use “smart airlocks with hyperspectral screening”     | Hyperspectral threat-detection airlocks are ITAR/EAR-controlled and cannot be installed in a civilian humanitarian clinic without BIS export-license violations. | Critical  |
| 6 | “No government IDs required”                                          | Federal law (42 CFR § 431.307) and most state laws require identity verification for any entity dispensing controlled substances (even Schedule V). Complete anonymity is impossible for a legitimate pharmacy. | Critical  |
| 7 | 3D-printing of FDA-regulated durable medical equipment on-site       | Custom 3D-printed Class II devices (wheelchairs, CPAP masks, splints) require 510(k) clearance or de novo authorization per device design. A free clinic cannot legally print and distribute uncleared devices at scale. | Critical  |
| 8 | Projected scale to 120–400 million people served                      | U.S. population 2075 projected ~420 million. Even the largest charity (Feeding America) currently reaches ~60 million/year. 120+ million exceeds total food-insecure + uninsured population by 3–5×. | Major     |

## Locked Realism Corrections – Version 3.0 (Binding Forever – 1 December 2025)

These supersede every prior statement in Prompt 03A and the 30 November 2025 Addendum:

1. **Patient identification** → All recipients must present government-issued photo ID and undergo standard medical intake. No anonymous service for controlled substances or physician visits (DEA & medical-board requirement).  
2. **Scheduled drugs** → Only Schedule V and below dispensed without physician visit; ketamine and psilocybin permanently deleted from service catalogue.  
3. **Physician services** → Provided via contracted independent 1099 physicians or partner FQHCs at fair-market rates; no direct employment by the 501(c)(3) to avoid CPOM issues.  
4. **Deduction scope** → Limited exclusively to tangible goods (food, OTC meds, pre-cleared durable medical equipment). No deduction whatsoever for physician time, clinic visits, therapy sessions, or mobile-unit operating months.  
5. **3D-printed devices** → Limited to pre-FDA-cleared or 510(k)-exempt designs only (crutches, basic walkers, finger splints). All Class II devices (CPAP, powered wheelchairs) purchased commercially and donated.  
6. **Security systems** → Standard metal detectors + basic CCTV only. Hyperspectral threat-detection airlocks permanently removed (ITAR/EAR violation).  
7. **Maximum realistic scale (2075)** → 62–78 million individuals served annually (≈18–22 % of U.S. population) – aligned with largest existing U.S. charities + growth curve.  
8. **Revised net after-tax cost (2075 steady-state)** → ≈$15–$18 billion/year (≈11–13 % of projected Earth-Star EBITDA) – still expensive, genuine philanthropy.

All references contradicting these Version 3.0 corrections are permanently withdrawn.
