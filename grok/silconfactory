## Project Summary

This mega-project establishes a sustainable industrial operation to refine standard quartz sand (95-98% SiO₂) from abundant, non-specialized deposits (e.g., river or beach sands) into high-purity silica and polysilicon. The facility, co-located with a single quartz sand mine, targets an annual output of 130,000 tons (~356 tons/day, 365-day operation), split as follows:

- **80% Ceramic Tiles**: ~104,000 tons/year (~285 tons/day), 99.5% purity silica powder (milled to 200-325 mesh) for glazes, frits, and tile bodies.
- **20% Semiconductor Chips**: ~26,000 tons/year (~71 tons/day), 99.9999% (6N) purity polysilicon for silicon wafers, suitable for advanced chips (e.g., NVIDIA H100 series).

The project prioritizes sustainability through zero landfill, 90% water recycling via zero-liquid discharge (ZLD), renewable energy (21-27 MW solar/wind/hydro), and carbon capture/storage (CCS) or CO₂-to-methanol conversion (~1,000-2,000 tons/year CO₂). Only finished products (silica powder, polysilicon ingots/wafers) and valuable byproducts (e.g., iron, aluminum, rare earth elements [REEs], lithium) are shipped, minimizing logistics and emissions.

### Key Innovations

- **Standard Sand Utilization**: Uses widely available quartz sand, expanding viable mining locations globally (thousands vs. ~10-20 for high-purity quartz [HPQ]).
- **Advanced Technologies**: Employs bio-leaching (replacing hazardous acids) and microwave plasma purification for energy-efficient impurity removal.
- **Circular Economy**: Sludge from bio-leaching is incinerated using waste heat, with ash refined to recover silica (4-6 tons/day), Fe₂O₃ (1-2 tons/day), Al₂O₃ (1-2 tons/day), CaO/MgO (1-2 tons/day), REEs (0.01-0.1 tons/day), and lithium as Li₂CO₃ (0.01-0.1 tons/day).
- **Net-Zero Emissions**: Achieved via renewable energy, ZLD, and CCS/CO₂ conversion.

### Project Evolution

- **Initial Concept**: Refining 130,000 tons/year using acid leaching; shifted to bio-leaching for sustainability.
- **Purity Upgrade**: From 99.999% (5N) to 6N for chips.
- **Output Adjustment**: From 70/30 to 80/20 (tiles/chips) split to prioritize ceramic cash flow.
- **Sustainability Enhancements**: Waste heat for sludge incineration, ash refining for zero landfill, and co-extraction of REEs (e.g., Ce, La, Nd) and lithium for revenue (~$1,200-9,000/day from byproducts).
- **Comparison to Traditional Methods**: Offers 5-10x more mining locations, 40-70% lower energy/emissions, and byproduct revenue, but requires piloting for emerging technologies.

## Technical Process Breakdown

### 1. Feedstock Preparation
- **Input**: Mine 420 tons/day (153,000 tons/year) standard quartz sand on-site.

- **Output**: ~400 tons/day at 98-99% SiO₂ purity.

### 2. Primary Purification (Bio-Leaching)
- **Input**: ~400 tons/day.
- **Process**: Treat in continuous-flow bioreactors (30-50°C, 12-24 hours) using bacteria (e.g., Bacillus subtilis) to produce organic acids, dissolving impurities (Fe, Al, Ti, Li, REEs). Wash with recycled deionized (DI) water.

  - Silica: ~4-6 tons/day (recycled to process).
  - Fe₂O₃/Al₂O₃/CaO/MgO: ~1-2 tons/day each.
  - REEs: ~0.01-0.1 tons/day (mixed oxides, separated via solvent extraction).
