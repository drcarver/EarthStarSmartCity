# Genesis Network Master Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

The Genesis Network by Earth-Star Industries is a regenerative, closed-loop ecosystem transforming distressed lands, brownfields, and landfills into self-sustaining hubs for food, energy, water, materials, electronics, and community services. Achieving 95–99% resource closure, it aims for post-scarcity by internalizing U.S. goods/services into regenerative cities by 2060s, supported by farmer partnerships and innovation hubs. Viability enhancements include microbial inoculants (+10–30% yields), blockchain credits ($150–250/tCO₂e), agroforestry kits, DAC pilots, and infrastructure recycling (RCA concrete + ceramic cladding, 15–30% savings).

Recalculated (Jan 2026 data): Land $3K–5K/acre; tents $100/m²/year; greenhouses $3–5M/ha; revenues ramp from $5B (2027) to $150B/year (2050). Network CAPEX $20–40B (offset 20–30% grants); NPV ~$50B (7% discount); IRR 30–35%; break-even 2029. Schedule: Pilots 2027–2030 (10 hubs); scale 2031–2040 (100 hubs, 10K affiliates); maturity 2041–2050 (500 hubs, 50K affiliates, gigaton negativity).
