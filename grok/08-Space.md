## 1. Strategic Vision – Space Expansion Rationale

Earth-based expansion reaches practical limits by the 2070s–2080s: land saturation, political fragmentation, resource constraints, and population stabilization (~10–12 billion global peak). The Genesis replication model (pod-centric, self-replicating, closed-loop ceramics) enables extension to space:

- **Luna**: Low-gravity factories + mass drivers for orbital construction materials  
- **Mars**: Terraforming pilots + regenerative cities using Genesis pods  
- **Asteroid Mining**: Resource extraction (metals, volatiles) via robotic probes  
- **O'Neill Cylinders**: Orbital habitats (rotating for gravity, closed-loop ecosystems)  
- **Von Neumann Probes**: Self-replicating robotic explorers using Genesis techniques (ceramic shells, replication kits) for interstellar expansion  

**Sensor Nets Role**  
Hyper-dense Earth-based sensor arrays (tiles, hubs, restoration sites) + orbital constellations provide real-time data for trajectory planning, resource mapping, radiation monitoring, and simulation of space environments → ruthless optimization of off-world replication.

**Core Principles**  
- Self-funded via Earth revenues (tiles, gases, credits, royalties)  
- Sovereign control: U.S./NATO-aligned initially; open to partners under bilateral agreements  
- Replication-first: Pods + kits bootstrap off-world factories  
- No human risk early: Robotic precursors + telepresence

## 3. Recomputed Costs & Financials (Space Phase)

**Total Space CAPEX (2050–2150)**: $35–150 trillion (phased; Earth revenues fund 70–90%)  
- **2051–2065**: $0.8–2.5T (sensor nets, lunar precursors, mass driver R&D)  
- **2066–2085**: $3–10T (lunar factories, asteroid mining fleets)  
- **2086–2110**: $10–30T (Mars cities, first O'Neill cylinder)  
- **2111–2150**: $20–100T+ (Von Neumann probes, multi-system replication)  

**Revenue Projections (Space-Enabled)**  
- **2050s**: Baseline Earth $500–2,000B/year  
- **2060s–2080s**: +$5–20T/year (lunar materials export, asteroid metals, orbital manufacturing)  
- **2090s–2150**: Exponential (O'Neill habitats, interstellar resources) – $50T–$1Q/year potential  

**Updated Network Metrics**  
- NPV (7% discount, 2050–2200): $15–$45 trillion (original $4T + space synergies)  
- IRR: 35–45% (dilution from space CAPEX offset by material abundance)  
- Break-even (space phase): 2075–2085 (lunar mass drivers online)  

## 4. Key Space Components & Adaptations
