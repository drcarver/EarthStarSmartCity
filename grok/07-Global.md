# Earth-Star Industries Global Open Access Programme – Prompt 7  
**“Open Door” Phase – Validated Master Specification (November 2025)**

## Executive Summary

The Global Open Access Programme begins **1 January 2085** — only after the Fortress West Programme has ≥1,800 fully operational MHUE-class districts and ≥400 million people housed/fed outside adversarial spheres. It extends the **exact same licensing, royalty, JV, and proprietary-retention terms** used in Canada, Mexico, NATO, and Latin America to **any non-sanctioned sovereign nation** that voluntarily applies and meets transparent neutrality & human-rights criteria.

No debt-trap diplomacy, no military pressure, no forced transfers. Nations simply sign the identical standard agreement used in São Paulo, Oslo, or Santiago. By 2150, the programme is projected to add **19,123 additional districts** (∼956 million people) across Africa, Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and remaining Europe — bringing global total to **28,803 districts** and >1.4 billion people living in Earth-Star cities. Total additional capex $14.4 trillion (2025 USD), 100 % funded by host-nation budgets, development banks, sovereign wealth, and 5 % Earth-Star royalties. Aggressive case IRR 22 %, NPV (6 %) $32 trillion.

## 3. Identical Licensing Terms – “Same Deal as the Americas”

| Term                                      | Detail                                                                 |

## 7. Aggressive but 100 % Honest Global Feasibility Analysis

**Strengths**  
- Identical contract used everywhere removes negotiation friction  
- 5 % royalty is politically survivable (cheaper than most infrastructure tolls)  
- No adversarial nations included — purely opt-in  

**Hard Limits**  
- Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and close allies permanently excluded (ITAR + Earth-Star board policy)  
- Some African & Asian nations may default on royalty payments during crises — mitigated via carbon-credit escrow  
- Global tile demand peaks at 102 billion m²/year — within licensed capacity but requires flawless logistics  

**Realpolitik Ceiling**  
19,123 additional districts is the maximum achievable with purely voluntary adoption and zero military leverage. Any attempt to force adoption collapses the model.

**Overall Feasibility** — 84 % for aggressive 2140 completion. The programme is designed as a “take it or leave it” offer — nations that want food security, rewilding, and modern cities will sign; others won’t. No illusions, no overreach.
