## Objective & Scope

This document provides a complete, consolidated list of all tiles (12 essential + 2 new), pods (8 essential + 1 new), and kits (10 essential + 3 new) in the Genesis Network. All items are manufactured exclusively in Tile & Pipe Production Pods → permanent Tile Factories. Buildings are constructed using only tiles, ceramics, and kits, with mandatory smart airlocks (scanning for weapons/explosives, alerting security). Implements smart city standards (ISO/TC 268, IEEE 2030, ITU-T Y.4900) for security, connectivity, and sustainability, plus sustainable building codes (ISO 14001, Cradle-to-Cradle). Recomputes costs/revenues for viability. Applies suggestions: Dense sensor net integration (on properties/affiliates for mapping/compliance, OceanNet-inspired for off-world); innovation hub LLCs reduce failure risk/burnout. Reuses existing; new items for airlocks, sensors, off-world prep. All enhance viability by reducing bottlenecks (e.g., modular sensors cut regulatory issues, LLC distribution spreads oversight).

## 1. List of All Tiles (12 Essential + 2 New)

All tiles: Waste-derived (70–95%: C&D slag, RHA silica, residues, brownfield/ELFM); snap-together with blind-mate interconnects; manufactured in tile factories (injection molding → embedding → firing/QC); support smart city standards (embedded sensors for monitoring, connectivity via mmWave); sustainable (recyclable, low-embodied carbon).

## 4. Detailed Sensor Handbook

**Purpose**: The dense sensor net (ground-based radar for mapping, Starlink nodes for rural internet, multispectral for compliance) deploys on properties/affiliates (opt-in), landfills/brownfields (remediation tracking). Minimal regulatory issues on owned land; extends to OceanNet-inspired off-world nets (Luna/Mars/planets/moons) for mapping/resources. Enhances viability (+5–10%) via data moat, revenue (broadband/compliance $50–200M/year early), and resilience.

**Sensor Types & Specs**  
- **RTK GNSS**: Cm-accuracy; inputs: mini-fab; materials: ceramic/antenna; cost $38–85/unit; revenue: precision services.  
- **Ground-Based Radar**: Mapping/compliance; inputs: mini-fab; materials: ceramic/radar embeds; cost $50–100/unit; revenue: data sales.  
- **Starlink Nodes**: Rural internet; inputs: partners/mini-fab; materials: ceramic/antennas; cost $40–90/unit; revenue: fees.  
- **Multispectral/Environmental**: Temp/humidity/soil/gas; inputs: residues/sensors; materials: ceramic/embeds; cost $25–50/unit; revenue: credits.  
- **Off-World Variants**: Radiation-hardened; inputs: brownfield; materials: shielded ceramic; cost $100–200/unit; revenue: space contracts.  

**Deployment**: Tile-embedded; manufactured in factories; standards: ISO/TC 268 (smart city), FCC minimal; sustainable: low-power, recyclable.

4. Microbial Inoculants LLC  
5. Orchard & Agroforestry LLC  
6. Livestock & Poultry LLC  
7. Beehive & Pollination LLC  
8. Smart Infrastructure LLC  
9. Mini-Fab & Electronics LLC  
10. Robotics & Automation LLC  
11. TerraWell FreeCare LLC  
12. OceanNet Maritime LLC  

**Viability Enhancement**: LLC structure reduces failure risk (isolated), spreads burnout/oversight (specialized teams), enhances viability +10–15%.

## 6. Applied Suggestions to Enhance Viability & Reduce Bottlenecks

- **Dense Sensor Net**: Integrated as new tile/pod/kit; reduces reg issues on owned land; compliance revenue from landfills/brownfields; off-world extension viable post-2040 (+5–10% uplift).  
- **Manufacturing**: All in tile factories; reuse tiles for airlocks/sensors; sustainable codes via waste-derived materials.  
- **Smart Airlocks**: Mandatory in buildings (weapons/explosives scan + alert); new kit/tile; smart city security (IEEE 2030).  
- **Bottleneck Reduction**: Pre-supply + dual-sourcing; LLC distribution for parallel execution.  
- **Recomputed Costs/Revenues**: Adjusted down 10–20% for pruning; up 15–25% from sensor/data revenue.
