# Genesis Network: Comprehensive List of Tiles, Pods, Kits, Manufacturing, Costs & Revenues

**Version Date:** January 2026  
**Prepared by:** EarthStar Technologies Conceptual Framework  
**License:** This work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

All buildings and structures in the Genesis Network are constructed exclusively from **toughened ceramic tiles**, **ceramic kits**, and **modular pod assemblies**. No virgin materials are used beyond initial bootstrapping; 70–95% waste-derived at maturity. All tiles and kits are manufactured in on-site tile factories (tent → permanent ceramic shells).

**Smart Airlocks**: Every building entrance features dual airlocks with mmWave/multispectral scanning for weapons/explosives/pathogens. Alerts trigger security response (on-site drones/robots or human teams). Complies with ISO/TC 268 smart city standards, IEEE 2030 smart grid, NIST cybersecurity, and MIL-STD-810 ruggedness.

**Smart City Standards Supported**:
- ISO/TC 268 (Sustainable Cities)
- ISO 37120 (City Indicators)
- IEEE 2030 (Smart Grid)
- ISO 14001 (Environmental Management)
- ITU-T Y.4900 (Smart Sustainable Cities)
- Dark Sky compliance (shielded lighting)

**Viability Enhancements Implemented**:
- Local digital twins for sensor data sovereignty (selective export, compliance with GDPR/CCPA/national laws).
- Distributed LLC structure for risk isolation and burnout mitigation.
- Early self-funding focus (greens/tiles/biogas).
- Microbial inoculants + agroforestry for yield/sequestration boosts.
- Blockchain credits for monetization.
