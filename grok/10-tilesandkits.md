## Overview & Viability Enhancements

All Genesis Network construction uses only toughened ceramic tiles, pipes, and flat-pack kits produced on-site from waste-derived materials (70–95% C&D slag, rice husk ash silica, farm residues, ELFM/brownfield slag). This eliminates external supply chains, minimizes costs, and maximizes closure.

**Viability Enhancements Implemented**:
- All tiles/kits produced in Tile Production Pods → permanent factories (retrofit for zero downtime).
- Smart Airlock Kit mandatory in every building (mmWave/hyperspectral scanning for weapons/explosives/pathogens; AI alerts).
- Full smart city standards (ISO/TC 268, IEEE 2030, ITU-T Y.4900) + sustainable codes (Cradle-to-Cradle, ISO 14001).
- Reused/modular kits reduce CAPEX 30–50%; pre-supply from mature hubs cuts bootstrap time 70–90%.
- Costs/revenues recalculated (2026 baseline): Lower CAPEX via modularity; higher revenues from premiums/security features.
