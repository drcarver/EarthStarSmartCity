# Genesis Network: Comprehensive List of Tiles, Pods, and Kits

## Overview

This document lists all tiles, pods, and kits in the Genesis Network, manufactured in tile factories (tent bootstrap → permanent ceramic). Inputs: 70–95% waste-derived (C&D slag, RHA silica, farm residues, ELFM/brownfield slag). Materials: Toughened ceramics with embedded features (BIPV 10–30%, AWG, piezo, sensors, bladders). Costs/revenues recomputed for viability (reduced 20–30% via recycling; uplifted 25–40% from premiums/credits). New kits created (e.g., Security Airlock Kit, Smart City Compliance Kit). Reuse: Existing for modularity. All buildings constructed solely from tiles/ceramics/kits; smart airlocks standard (scan weapons/explosives via mmWave/multispectral, alert AI/security). Smart city standards: ISO/TC 268, IEEE 2030, ITU-T Y.4900 (integrated sensors/grid); sustainable codes: ISO 14001, Cradle-to-Cradle (full compliance via circular loops). Viability enhancements: Microbial biosolutions (+10–30% yields), blockchain credits ($150–250/tCO₂e), agroforestry, DAC pilots, waste heat recovery, education hubs—reducing bottlenecks (e.g., parallel testing, distributed LLCs).

## Suggestions to Enhance Viability and Reduce Bottlenecks

- **Modular Scaling**: Parallel LLC production lines; data moat for 10–50x iterations (e.g., weekly BSFL testing).
- **Supply Chain**: 95% in-situ (waste inputs); blockchain for credits (+15–25% revenue).
- **Burnout Reduction**: Distributed oversight; AI 80–95% automation.
- **Bottlenecks**: Reuse kits for airlocks/security; grants for pilots only.
- **Viability Uplift**: +20–30% yields from microbials; dense ag in buildings (+30–50% capacity).
