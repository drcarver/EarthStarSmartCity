# Genesis Network – Complete Inventory of Tiles, Pods, Kits, Manufacturing, Economics, Sensors & LLC Structure

**Version**: Master Consolidated Inventory – January 2026  
**Core Manufacturing Rule**: All tiles, pods, kits and building components are produced exclusively within the Tile & Pipe Production Pod → permanent ceramic factories. All buildings and fixed infrastructure are constructed **only** from Genesis toughened ceramic tiles, ceramic modules and self-replicating flat-pack kits. No virgin concrete, steel, asphalt or non-recycled aggregates are permitted beyond minimal RCA bases where structurally unavoidable.

**Security & Standards Compliance**  
- **Smart Airlocks**: Every building, pod cluster and fixed facility includes dual smart airlocks with mmWave radar + multispectral imaging + metal/explosive trace detection. Alerts route to local security AI → human response teams. Faraday mesh + EMP hardening standard.  
- **Smart City Standards**: Full alignment with ISO/TC 268 (sustainable cities), ISO 37120 (city indicators), IEEE 2030 (smart grid), ITU-T Y.4900 (smart sustainable cities), NIST cybersecurity framework.  
- **Sustainable Building Codes**: Cradle-to-Cradle certified materials, net-zero energy/water, 95–99% resource closure, passive-dominant design, LEED Platinum / Living Building Challenge equivalent targets.
