# Genesis Network Tiles, Kits, Sensors, and LLCs

## Overview

This document lists all tiles and kits in the Genesis Network, detailing manufacturing, inputs, materials, costs, and revenues (recomputed for January 2026 data: materials $0.5–1/m², labor/energy $1–2/m², margins 60–80%). New kits added for smart airlocks (scanning weapons/explosives, alerting security) and compliance with smart city standards (ISO/TC 268, IEEE 2030) and sustainable codes (LEED equivalents via sensors). Viability enhancements: Reuse kits for modularity (reduce bottlenecks 20–30%); affiliate production for scale; AI optimization cuts costs 10–15%. All from tile factory; buildings use only tiles/ceramics/kits. Smart airlocks in all buildings for security.

## List of All Tiles and Kits

| Name | Description | Manufacturing Process | Input Sources | Materials | Cost ($/unit or m²) | Revenue ($/unit or m²) |
|------|-------------|-----------------------|---------------|-----------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Toughened Ceramic Tiles | Snap-together structural/insulating/permeable tiles with embedded sensors/PV/conduits. | Mixing, forming, drying, firing in kilns (1,200–1,400°C), plasma integration. | Farm residues (70–95%), landfill slag, virgin clays (minimal). | Composite ceramics (silica from RHA, tougheners from bagasse). | 2–4 | 3–5 (margins 50–60%) |
| Modular Ceramic Greenhouse Tiles | Glazing/BIPV panels for greenhouses. | RHA-derived glass-ceramics, embedding sensors. | Farm wastes, residues. | Glass-ceramics, PV elements. | 5–8 | 10–15 |

| Biorefinery Kit | Digesters, plasma units. | Modular assembly. | Wastes for components. | Ceramics, metals (recycled). | 100K–200K | 200K–400K (byproducts) |
| Restoration Kit | For blue-green carbon/wetlands. | Kit packing. | Natural materials, sensors. | Biodegradable, ceramics. | 10K–20K | 20K–40K (credits uplift) |
| Microbial Inoculant Kit (New) | Fermenters for custom inoculants. | Bioreactor assembly. | Digestate, wastes. | Ceramics, sensors. | 5K–10K | 10K–20K |
| Smart Airlock Kit (New) | Airlocks scanning weapons/explosives, alerting security; hyperspectral/facial recognition. | Embedding sensors in ceramic doors. | Electronics from mini-fab. | Ceramics, sensors. | 2K–5K/unit | 5K–10K (security premium) |
| Compliance Kit (New) | For smart city/sustainable codes (ISO 37120, LEED monitoring). | Sensor arrays, software. | Mini-fab outputs. | Electronics, ceramics. | 1K–3K | 3K–6K |

Costs/revenues recomputed: Inputs down 10% via recycling; revenues up 15% from premiums/credits. New kits reduce bottlenecks by enabling on-site compliance/security.

## Detailed Sensor Handbook

### Overview
Sensors form the data moat, with 3–5x redundancy per point for fault tolerance. All feed AI/digital twins for optimization/compliance (FDA/GMP, smart city KPIs). Types: Electrochemical (nutrients/pH), optical (pathogens), nanobiosensors (stress), mmWave radar (health/security), multispectral (pests). Phased: Commercial start, custom via mini-fab.

### Sensor Types and Applications
- **Environmental Sensors**: Temperature, humidity, CO₂ (IEEE 1451); in greenhouses/farms; cost $10–50/unit.
- **Security Sensors**: Hyperspectral/facial in airlocks (weapon/explosive detection, alert security); MIL-STD-810 rugged; $100–200/unit.
- **Health Sensors**: mmWave for vitals (NASA-STD-3001); in housing/hospitals; $50–100/unit.
- **Compliance Sensors**: For ISO 14001/37120 (emissions, energy); automated reporting; $20–50/unit.
- **Deployment**: Redundant arrays; edge AI processing; privacy via local compute/opt-in.

### Handbook Guidelines
- Installation: Snap-in to tiles; PoE powered.
- Maintenance: AI drift detection; 5-year lifespan.
- Data Handling: Blockchain logs for audits; anonymized aggregates.
- Standards: IEEE 2030 (interoperability), OGC SWE (web enablement).

Viability: Sensors cut failures 50–80% via predictive maintenance; revenue from data services (+$100–200M/hub/year).

## Suggestions to Enhance Viability and Reduce Bottlenecks

- **Modular Reuse**: Reuse 70–80% kits across phases (e.g., airlock kits in all buildings); reduces supply chain bottlenecks 25%.
- **Affiliate Scaling**: 10K–50K affiliates produce kits locally; cuts central factory load 30–40%.
- **AI Optimization**: Data moat for predictive manufacturing; lowers costs 10–15%, boosts revenues via efficiencies.
- **Diversification**: LLCs enable parallel revenue (e.g., sensors from Mini-Fab fund expansions).
- **Compliance Integration**: Built-in standards reduce regulatory delays 20%; sustainable codes via sensors attract premiums.
