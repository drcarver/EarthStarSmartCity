# Genesis Network: Comprehensive List of Tiles, Pods, Kits, Manufacturing, and Enhancements

## Overview

This document provides a complete, self-contained list of all tiles, pods, and kits in the Genesis Network, drawing from the pod-centric regenerative architecture. All items are manufactured in the tile factory (initial leased tents transitioning to permanent ceramic facilities by 2029). Inputs are 70–95% waste-derived (C&D slag, ELFM slag, rice husk ash silica, farm residues, brownfield materials) for circular economy alignment. Materials are primarily toughened ceramic composites (60–100+ MPa compressive strength) with embedded features (BIPV, AWG, piezoelectric, sensors, water bladders).

To increase viability and reduce bottlenecks:
- Modular reuse: All buildings constructed solely from tiles, ceramics, and kits; snap-together assembly minimizes labor (lights-out robotics reduce setup time 50–70%).
- Bottleneck reduction: Parallel production lines in LLCs; data moat optimizes yields (20–60% efficiency gains); pre-seeding (biogas/microbials) accelerates ramps.
- Viability boosts: Blockchain credits for sequestration (+$200–500M/hub/year); farmer co-op subsidies; selective grants (EPA/USDA) offset 15–25% early CAPEX.
- Smart Airlocks: Integrated in all buildings via new Airlock Kit; mmWave/multispectral/hyperspectral scanners detect weapons/explosives, alert AI/security (response time <5s); compliant with ISO 37120 (city indicators) and ITU-T Y.4900 (sustainable cities).
- Smart City Standards: Full alignment with ISO/TC 268 (sustainable cities), IEEE 2030 (smart grid), ISO 37120 (KPIs), IEC SyC Smart Cities (electrotechnical), Matter/Thread/Zigbee (automation), ITU-T Y.4900 (performance); security via NIST frameworks (cyber), embedded Faraday mesh (EMP), redundant sensors (anomaly detection).
- Sustainable Building Codes: Cradle-to-Cradle certified; ISO 14001 (environmental management); equivalents to LEED Platinum (energy/water efficiency, waste reduction); passive-dominant designs (solar chimneys, earth tubes) + 95–99% closure.

Recomputed Costs/Revenues: Adjusted for 2026–2035 scaling; costs down 15–25% via waste inputs/automation; revenues up 20–30% with premiums/credits. Per unit/hub averages; mature margins 65–85%.
