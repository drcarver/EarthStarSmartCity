# Genesis Network Tiles, Kits, and Sensor Handbook

## Executive Summary

This document lists all tiles and kits in the Genesis Network, manufactured exclusively in tile factories from waste-derived ceramics (70–95% farm residues/ELFM slag, minimal virgin). All buildings use these tiles/studs/kits, with integrated smart airlocks scanning for weapons/explosives (hyperspectral sensors alerting security). Compliance with smart city standards (ISO/TC 268, IEEE 2030) and sustainable codes (LEED equivalents, net-zero). Viability enhancements: Reduced bottlenecks via affiliate-sourced inputs (20% cost cut); modular upgrades; AI-optimized production (15% efficiency gain). Recomputed costs/revenues: Avg. tile cost $2/m² (down 33%), revenue $4–6/m²; kits $5K–$500K, margins 60–80%. Total network revenue uplift +10% to $550B/year by 2050.

## Viability Enhancements and Bottleneck Reductions

- **Input Diversification**: 30% inputs from affiliates (farm residues), reducing central hub dependency; blockchain tracking for compliance.
- **Automation Scale**: Lights-out factories with telepresence; AI predictive maintenance cuts downtime 50%.
- **Modular Upgrades**: Snap-in tile replacements for obsolescence; recycle 95% old materials.
- **Revenue Streams**: Royalty-free internal use; 4–6% on exports; carbon credits ($150/tCO₂e) from sustainable codes.
- **Standards Integration**: ISO 14001/37120 compliance via sensors; LEED Platinum via passive design/net-zero.
- **Bottleneck Mitigation**: Parallel production lines; affiliate mini-fabs for kits (decentralize 40% output).

## List of All Tiles

All tiles manufactured in cylindrical factories: Mixing waste (rice husk ash, bagasse, slag) with minimal virgin (clay 5–10%), forming/extruding, drying (waste heat), firing (1,200–1,400°C plasma-licensed kilns), embedding sensors/PV. Inputs: 70–95% waste, 5–30% virgin. Materials: Toughened silica-based ceramics. Cost: $2/m² avg. (bulk production). Revenue: $4–6/m² (sales/exports).
