# Genesis Network Components Catalog  
**Tiles, Pods, Kits, Sensor Handbook, LLCs, and Viability Enhancements**  
*Aggressively Optimized for Self-Funding and Bottleneck Reduction – January 18, 2026*

## Executive Overview

This document catalogs all **tiles**, **pods**, and **kits** in the Genesis Network, emphasizing pod-first modularity for rapid self-funding (target positive cash Month 8–12). All components are manufactured in the Ceramic Tile Production Pod/Factory (tent bootstrap → permanent), using 70–95% waste-derived inputs (C&D slag, RHA silica, farm residues, ELFM slag). Materials: Toughened ceramics (compressive 60–100+ MPa). 

**Viability Enhancements Implemented**:  
- **Rapid Self-Funding Focus**: Prioritize high-margin pods (greens, poultry, biogas) in Year 1; recalculated revenues assume premium branding (+20–30% via chef partnerships); costs reduced 15–25% via reuse (e.g., recycled ISO containers, shared smart pipes).  
- **Bottleneck Reduction**: Innovation hub LLCs distribute oversight (e.g., separate teams per pod type); self-replicating kits double capacity every 6–12 months; staggered cycles ensure continuous output.  
- **Risk Spreading**: Pod modularity isolates failures; new "Fallback Kit" for quick swaps if a pod underperforms.  
- **Security & Standards**: All buildings/pods include smart airlocks (scanning for weapons/explosives via mmWave/multispectral + AI alert to security LLC); compliance with ISO/TC 268 (smart cities), IEC SyC Smart Cities, IEEE 2030 (grids), ISO 14001 (environmental), UN SDGs, and sustainable codes (e.g., LEED equivalents via 95–99% closure).  
- **New Kits Created**: Fallback Kit, Security Airlock Kit, Sustainable Compliance Kit (for audits/reporting).  

Recomputed Costs/Revenues: Based on 2026 baselines (e.g., pod fit-out $40–110k; greens revenue $400–700k/ha); assume 60–80% margins at scale; network IRR 30–45%.
