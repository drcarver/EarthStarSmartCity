## 1. Manufacturing Overview & Viability Enhancements

**All components** are manufactured in **Tile & Pipe Production Pods** → permanent **Tile Factories** (initial tent bootstrap → ceramic cluster retrofit).  
- **Inputs**: 70–95% waste-derived (C&D slag priority, rice husk ash silica, farm residues, ELFM/brownfield slag, recycled electronics/concrete).  
- **Materials**: Toughened ceramic composite (60–100+ MPa compressive strength; embedded features where applicable).  
- **Process**: Crushing/mixing → forming/extrusion/molding → sensor/embed lamination → firing (1,200–1,400°C biogas kilns) → module pocket integration → QC/testing.  
- **Automation**: 50–75% Day 1 → 85–95% mature (lights-out capable).  

**All buildings** are constructed exclusively from ceramic tiles, pods, and kits (snap-together, blind-mate interconnects). No legacy materials except temporary bootstrap.

**Smart Airlocks**: Integrated in **every building/pod** (housing, TerraWell, factories, hubs). Features mmWave/hyperspectral scanners + IMS/Raman trace detectors for weapons/explosives/drugs; AI anomaly alert to Security LLC.

**Dense Sensor Net**: Deployed across all properties (hubs/affiliates/landfills/brownfields) for mapping, remediation compliance, precision ag, and security. Minimal regulation (private land). Extended to off-world (Luna/Mars/asteroids) for navigation/resource mapping.

**Viability Impact**: +10–18% probability (compliance automation, data moat acceleration, security revenue).

**Recomputed Costs/Revenues**: Mature network efficiencies + waste closure reduce costs 15–25%; retail/affiliate channels uplift revenues 20–35%.

## 5. Detailed Sensor Handbook

Embedded sensors (3–5× redundancy standard):  
- **Strain/Vibration**: Structural health, piezo harvest optimization.  
- **Thermal/Humidity**: Microclimate, AWG efficiency.  
- **VOC/Gas (IMS/Raman)**: Air quality, threat detection.  
- **mmWave Radar**: Motion/intrusion/concealed objects.  
- **IR/Multispectral**: Thermal anomalies, chemical traces.  
- **Acoustic**: Tampering/behavior.  
- **RTK GNSS**: Positioning (tiles/badges).  
- **PPG/IMU (badges)**: Personal health.  

**Dense Net Deployment**: Private land → minimal regulation; brownfields for compliance tracking; off-world for navigation/mapping.
