# Genesis Network Tiles, Kits, and Components

## List of All Tiles

All tiles are manufactured in the on-site tile factory (leased tents transitioning to permanent facilities). Inputs: 70–95% waste-derived (farm residues like rice husk ash (RHA) for silica, sugarcane bagasse for toughening, landfill slag/brownfield materials); minimal virgin (clay, feldspar). Materials: Toughened composite ceramics with embedded features (sensors, PV, conduits, Faraday mesh). Costs/revenues recalculated: Production cost $2–4/m² (down 15% via efficiencies); revenue $4–6/m² (up 20% from premiums/credits). New tile: Security Airlock Tile for smart airlocks.
