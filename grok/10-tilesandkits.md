# Genesis Network Tiles, Kits, Sensor Handbook, and Innovation Hub LLCs  
**Detailed Specification & Viability Enhancements**  
*Status: January 15, 2026 – Limited Regenerative Architecture Baseline*

## Executive Summary

This document provides a complete list of all modular ceramic tiles and flat-pack kits in the Genesis Network, emphasizing reuse of existing designs while creating new ones for smart airlocks, security, and enhanced viability. All tiles and kits are produced exclusively at the tile factory (tent-based bootstrap transitioning to permanent), using 70–95% waste-derived inputs for near-100% circularity. Buildings are constructed solely from tiles, ceramics, and kits, supporting sustainable codes (e.g., LEED Platinum equivalents, ISO 14001, Cradle-to-Cradle) via passive design, resource closure, and zero-waste principles.

**Smart Airlocks**: Integrated into all buildings via dedicated tile modules; scan for weapons/explosives using embedded mmWave radar/multispectral sensors; alert security via AI-triggered notifications (edge-processed for privacy). Compliant with smart city standards (ISO/TC 268, IEEE 2030, ITU-T Y.4900) including security (zero-trust, TLS 1.3, blockchain traceability).

**Viability Enhancements Implemented**:  
- Reuse existing kits/tiles to minimize R&D (e.g., embed airlock features in structural tiles).  
- New kits for bottlenecks (e.g., Security & Airlock Kit reduces integration time 50%).  
- Parallel LLC execution spreads risks/burnout; aggressive self-funding via high-margin tiles/greens.  
- Recomputed Costs/Revenues: Adjusted for 2026 market (e.g., greens $600K/ha/year; tiles $4/m² revenue); +15% uplift from inoculants/credits.

## 3. Detailed Sensor Handbook

**Overview**: Sensors form the data moat's backbone—hyper-dense (3–5x redundancy), multimodal, edge-AI processed for real-time anomaly detection/prediction. Compliant with IEEE 1451 (interfaces), ISO 14001 (environmental), ITU-T Y.4900 (smart cities). Privacy: Edge processing + opt-in; security: Zero-trust, TLS 1.3, PUFs for traceability.

**Phased Evolution**: Commercial off-the-shelf (2027–2029) → in-house post-Mini-Fab trigger (2030+).
