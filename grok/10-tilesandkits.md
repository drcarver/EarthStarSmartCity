# Genesis Network  
**Complete Inventory: Tiles • Pods • Kits • Manufacturing • Economics**  
**Sensor Handbook • LLC Structure • Viability Enhancements**  
*Baseline – January 17, 2026*

## 1. All Tile Types (Produced in Ceramic Tile Factory)

All tiles are manufactured from **70–95% waste-derived inputs** at maturity.  
**Primary factory input sources** (ranked by volume):  
1. [Road C&D debris (slag, concrete fines, asphalt millings)](roadcandd,md)  
2. Rice husk ash (silica source)  
3. Farm residues (bagasse, straw, grape pomace – pore formers/tougheners)  
4. ELFM mined landfill slag  
5. Brownfield contaminated soil (after plasma vitrification)  
6. Early virgin materials (kaolin, feldspar – only bootstrap phase)

**Tile Manufacturing Overview**  
- Process: Mixing → extrusion/pressing → drying → high-temp firing (1,200–1,400°C) → plasma vitrification toughening  
- Energy: Biogas + waste heat recovery  
- Automation: Lights-out robotic handling  
- Output capacity (mature factory): 150,000–500,000 m²/month
