## 1. Manufacturing & Supply Chain Overview

All tiles, pods, and kits are manufactured exclusively from **Genesis Tile Production Facilities** (initial tent-based kilns → permanent ceramic factories).  
- **Inputs**: 70–95% waste-derived (C&D slag, rice husk ash silica, farm residues, ELFM slag, brownfield materials)  
- **Materials**: Toughened ceramic composite (60–100+ MPa compressive strength) + embedded features (BIPV, AWG, piezo, sensors, Faraday mesh)  
- **Manufacturing Path**: Tile Production Pods → temporary kilns → permanent cluster retrofits (6–12 months)  
- **Cost Basis**: Production $1.6–$5.0/ft² (varies by type); selling price $4.8–$14.0/ft² (premium for smart features)  
- **Revenue Model**: Internal use (zero-cost to Network) + external sales (60–85% margins); affiliate kit sales; premium upgrades  

**All buildings** (hubs, housing, TerraWell centers, factories) are constructed **exclusively** from tiles, ceramics, and flat-pack kits.  
**Smart Airlocks** (dual-entry, mmWave + hyperspectral scanning for weapons/explosives/pathogens) are mandatory in all structures and alert on-site security.  
**Smart City Standards**: ISO/TC 268, IEEE 2030, ITU-T Y.4900, Matter/Thread/Zigbee, ISO 14001, Cradle-to-Cradle.  
**Sustainable Building Codes**: Full compliance (passive design, net-zero energy/water, waste-derived materials, LEED-equivalent via sensors).

## 5. Detailed Sensor Handbook

**Sensor Types & Deployment**  
- **Electrochemical/Optical**: pH, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, DO, ORP, VOC, pathogen detection  
- **Nanobiosensors**: Soil microbial activity, plant stress  
- **mmWave/IR-UWB Radar**: Resident health monitoring (heart/respiration, fall detection)  
- **Multispectral**: Pest/disease early warning, PAR, soiling  
- **Piezo/Strain**: Structural integrity, traffic/vibration  
- **Thermal/Humidity**: Climate control, AWG optimization  

**Deployment Standards**  
- 3–5× redundancy per critical point  
- Edge AI processing (noise reduction, anomaly detection)  
- Cloud/network AI for predictive models  
- Privacy: Local/edge only for sensitive data; opt-in for personal health  
- Standards: IEEE 1451 (transducers), OGC SWE (interoperability), MIL-STD-810 (ruggedness)  

**Sensor Moat Flywheel**  
- Short cycles (microalgae/BSFL weekly) generate massive data  
- Parallel test tanks/pods (50–500 variants) → 10–50× experiments/year  
- Ruthless optimization: Underperforming designs eliminated in next cycle

## 7. Viability Enhancements & Bottleneck Reductions

- **Innovation Hub Decentralization**: 19 LLCs isolate failure; distributed oversight reduces burnout.  
- **Farmer Empowerment**: Loans/kits/revenue-share create political shield and distributed scaling.  
- **Sensor Net**: Dense radar + Starlink on properties for mapping/reclamation tracking; minimal regulatory issues (private land).  
- **Space Extension**: Sensor nets on Luna/Mars for planning; replication techniques enable off-world factories.  
- **Bottleneck Reductions**: Pre-supply from staging hubs; parallel testing; affiliate flywheel; modular upgrades.
