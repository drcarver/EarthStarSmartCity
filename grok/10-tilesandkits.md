# Genesis Network – Tiles, Kits, Manufacturing & Infrastructure Details  
*Status: January 15, 2026 – Consolidated, viability-optimized specification*

All buildings, infrastructure and fixed assets in the Genesis Network are constructed exclusively using **toughened ceramic tiles**, **ceramic pipes**, and **flat-pack modular kits** produced in the on-site tile factories.  

No conventional concrete, steel framing, or imported structural materials are used after Phase 1 bootstrap (except initial leased tent supports, phased out by 2029).

## 3. Manufacturing & Input Summary

**Centralized Production**  
All tiles and kit components are manufactured in **on-site cylindrical tile factories** (tent → permanent ceramic).  
Primary process:  
- Raw material prep → mixing → extrusion / LCM multi-material 3D printing → drying → high-temp firing (1,200–1,400°C) → embedding electronics (mini-fab) → QA & packaging.

**Input Sources (Mature Phase)**  
- **70–95% waste-derived**: Road/C&D spoil (primary), ELFM slag, rice husk ash (silica), farm residues (pore-formers), recycled PV/scrap metal  
- **<5% virgin** (early phase only): clay, feldspar, select dopants

- **Agroforestry expansion** → diversified outputs, front-loaded revenue  
- **DAC pilots** → premium credits, internal CO₂ utilization  
- **Parallel LLCs** → failure isolation + burnout distribution  
- **Tent bootstrap + relocation** → minimal sunk capital  
- **Farmer co-op ownership** → political shield + distributed scaling  
- **Dense vertical/rooftop ag** → +30–50% productive capacity, zero land increase  
- **Road/C&D as primary feedstock** → lowest cost input secured  

**Recomputed Metrics (network-wide, mature phase)**  
- CAPEX per hub: $1.1–2.3B (down 8–12% via RCA + microbial efficiency)  
- Revenue per hub: $1.05–2.4B (up 10–15% from credits + inoculants)  
- IRR: 32–42% (improved from parallel risk reduction)  
- Break-even: 2028–mid-2029 (accelerated by early high-margin tiles/credits)
