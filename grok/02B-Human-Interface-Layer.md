# Genesis Network: Dense Sensor Net & Basic Human Interface Layer (HIL)

## Executive Summary

The **Genesis Network** deploys a **minimal viable Basic HIL v1** consisting of three tightly integrated components: **RTK GNSS Tiles** (cm-level spatial truth grid), **Public WiFi Tiles** (free trusted connectivity), and **Basic Communicator Badge** (personal voice/biosensing/positioning node). This pruned layer delivers immediate value for early adoption, precision agriculture, remediation compliance, and affiliate onboarding while preserving privacy and minimizing complexity.

Replaces sprawling prior HIL, badge, RTK, WiFi, and sensor net elements. All components are manufactured in existing tile factories (waste-derived ceramics), snap-together, and self-powered (BIPV/piezo). Early revenue from affiliate perks, data services (compliance/ag mapping $50–$200M/year), and premium connectivity ($20–$100M/year). Network-wide potential $1–$4B/year by 2035.

Recomputed with February 2026 baseline (RTK module costs $99–$172, WiFi 6/6E hardware down 8–12%, badge BOM $28–$68): Production costs 5–10% lower; retail badge $89–$149; viability 9.5/10 with fast adoption flywheel (rural internet + positioning perks). Rollout: Phase 1–2 foundation (2026–2030) embeds RTK/WiFi tiles in all hubs; badges distributed to affiliates/residents.

## Project Overview

Genesis creates a sovereign, privacy-first interface layer between people and infrastructure using RTK tiles for positioning, WiFi tiles for connectivity, and badges for personal interaction. This Basic HIL v1 focuses on high-value early functions (precise location, trusted rural internet, basic voice/biosensing) while deferring advanced features (display walls, payments, full identity) to v2 (2032+).

## Deployment Strategy

- **Sequence**:
  1. RTK GNSS tiles embedded in all hubs/roads (spatial backbone)
  2. Public WiFi tiles in high-traffic areas (connectivity layer)
  3. Basic badges to affiliates/residents (adoption vector)
- **Manufacturing**: Tile factories produce shells/embeds; mini-fab for electronics.
- **Affiliate Perk**: Free badges + WiFi priority → accelerates onboarding.
- **Revenue Mix**: Affiliate perks (adoption), data services (compliance/ag), premium roaming/connectivity.

## Key Performance Characteristics

- **RTK GNSS Tiles**:
  - Accuracy: 1–3 cm in-network, 5–20 cm global fallback
  - Multi-constellation L1/L5; tile mesh corrections
  - Self-powered (BIPV/piezo); $38–$85 prod, $250–$450 selling
- **Public WiFi Tiles**:
  - WiFi 6/6E (100–500 Mbps/cluster); WPA3-Enterprise
  - Free in hubs/TerraWell; captive portal for guests
  - Self-powered; $40–$90 prod, $150–$350 selling
- **Basic Communicator Badge v1**:
  - Voice activation, on-device LLM, PPG HR/HRV, IMU fall detection
  - Bone-conduction + haptic; 7–14 day battery
  - Tile mesh primary; WiFi/cellular fallback
  - Privacy: Local-only data; ephemeral tokens
  - $28–$68 prod, $89–$149 retail

## Key Products and Outputs

### RTK GNSS Tiles

- **Purpose**: Sovereign cm-level positioning grid
- **Functions**: Ag guidance, remediation tracking, emergency location, construction
- **Revenue**: Embedded in hubs; external precision ag/construction sales

### Public WiFi Tiles

- **Purpose**: Free trusted rural/urban connectivity
- **Access**: Priority for badge holders; time-limited guest portal
- **Revenue**: Connectivity fees, premium roaming, data services

### Basic Communicator Badge v1

- **Purpose**: Personal node for voice, biosensing, positioning
- **Capabilities**: Wake word, basic queries, HR/HRV, fall detection, RTK lock
- **Revenue**: Affiliate/resident adoption, premium upgrades

## Integrated Basic HIL Flow

1. RTK tiles broadcast corrections → badge achieves cm-level fix
2. Badge connects via tile mesh or WiFi tile → low-power sovereign link
3. User speaks wake word → on-device response (basic queries)
4. Presence shared anonymously via ephemeral tokens (airlocks/walls)
5. Biosensor/location data remains local unless consented

## Manufacturing & Financial Notes (Recomputed)

- **Production**: Tile factories + mini-fab; costs down 5–10% (2026 efficiencies)
- **Revenue Potential** (2035 mature):
  - Data services (compliance/ag): $50–$200M/year early → $500M–$2B mature
  - Connectivity/premium roaming: $20–$100M/year early → $500M–$2B mature
  - Badge adoption: $100–$400M/year
  - Total HIL: $1–$4B/year
- **Payback**: 6–12 months per hub deployment

## Sensors and Digital Twins

Tiles provide dense sensor backbone; badges feed anonymized vitals; twins use data for precision/optimization.

## Education & Training System

Includes badge/HIL usage training.

## Smart Roads and Infrastructure

RTK tiles in roads; WiFi tiles at intersections.

## Land Acquisition Strategy

HIL enhances site precision and connectivity value.

## Detailed Phased Implementation Plan (Recomputed)

### Phase 1: Bootstrap (2026–2028)

- Embed RTK/WiFi tiles in all structures. CAPEX $10–$25M/hub. Revenue $5–$20M/year (early data/connectivity). Net +$3–$12M.

### Phase 2: Scale & Closure (2028–2030)

- Full badge distribution; premium services. Revenue $50–$200M/year/hub. CAPEX $20–$50M. Net +$30–$150M.

### Phase 3: Exponential (2030–2035)
