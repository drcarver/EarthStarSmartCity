# MHUE-50k Smart City – Final Realistic Master Plan (Version 4.0)

**First city groundbreaking:** Q1 2038 (only after Genesis-2 and first two Skyscraper Farms are strongly cash-flow positive)  
**All previous claims are permanently superseded by Version 3.0 corrections (4 December 2025)**

## Core Mission (Final – Achievable)
Develop a privately financed, market-rate/attainable-luxury hybrid city for 50,000 residents that:
- Is built 100 % from Genesis ceramic flat-pack kits assembled by TerraBot™ swarms
- Integrates high-performance ceramic-clad mid- and high-rise buildings with embedded BIPV, FogCapture™, and smart-wall panels
- Co-locates a 150 MW hyperscale AI data center and a 6 GWh/year LFP battery factory as anchor tenants
- Achieves LEED Platinum, WELL Platinum, and Fitwel 3-Star certification
- Remains fully separated from any TerraFab or pharmaceutical operations

## Honest Feasibility Assessment (December 2025)
- **Technical**: Fully achievable with 2025–2046 Genesis kit system and licensed data-center/battery partners
- **Regulatory**: 100 % compliant with CHIPS/BIS separation rules, ITAR/EAR, BIPA/CCPA, and local zoning
- **Financial**: Bankable at 10.6 % equity IRR with full incentive stack and anchor tenant pre-leases
- **Primary risks**:
  - Data-center power availability and grid interconnection delays
  - Construction labor and TerraBot™ scaling in high-rise environment
  - Potential reduction in IRA incentives post-2032
- **Verdict**: Challenging but realistic, politically supported, and financeable new-city development
