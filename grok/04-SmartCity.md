**Total built area:** 2.85 million m² across 38 major buildings  
**Total project cost:** $18.4 billion (2035–2041)  
**Public & grant funding applied:** $7.9 billion (43 %)  
**Private capital required:** $10.5 billion  
**IRR (unlevered):** 16.8 % • **NPV @ 8 %:** $22.1 billion • **Payback:** 8.2 years

| Capital scale                 | Comparable to early NEOM / Masdar phases           | 40-year municipal green bonds + USDA guarantees|

**Conclusion:** MHUE-50k is fully financeable, regulator-ready, and profitable using only technology and policy frameworks that exist in November 2025. It is the first reproducible blueprint for American new cities that can be stamped out at scale using the Genesis tile/kit supply chain.
