## Executive Summary

The Genesis Network roadmap integrates proven NASA/ISS technologies as foundational building blocks, creating bidirectional feedback loops:  
1. **ISS/Space Station Experiments** → refined techniques/data → Earth regenerative hubs  
2. **Earth Hubs** → scaled production + real-world validation → lunar/Mars settlements  
3. **Lunar/Mars Settlements** → in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) + new data → Earth closure improvements + deeper space expansion  

This creates an accelerating virtuous cycle: space tech matures Earth systems faster → Earth abundance funds off-world scale → off-world returns compound Earth capability.

**Financial Snapshot (Recalculated)**

- **2051–2076**: Cumulative CAPEX $2.5–8T; Revenue $25–120T/year by 2076  
- **NPV (7% discount, to 2076)**: $5.5–18T  
- **IRR (network-wide)**: 235–320%

**Key Feedback Loops**  
- **ISS → Earth**: Life support, radiation, plant growth, water recycling → higher closure, better yields, safer habitats.  
- **Earth → Lunar/Mars**: Scaled production (tiles, pods, ceramics) + sensor nets → rapid construction, resource mapping.  
- **Lunar/Mars → Earth**: ISRU, mass drivers, radiation shielding → lower costs, new materials, off-world tech back to Earth.  
- **Asteroids → Everywhere**: Unlimited resources → exponential scale, reduced Earth mining.
