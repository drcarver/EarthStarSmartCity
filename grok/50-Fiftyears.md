# Genesis Network 50-Year Roadmap  
**NASA/ISS Tech Integration, Feedback Loops, and Financial Projections**  
**2026–2076**

## Overview

This roadmap explicitly traces technologies originating from or validated by NASA/ISS programs, showing closed feedback loops:
1. NASA/ISS → Earth Genesis Hubs (terrestrial validation & scaling)
2. Earth Hubs → Lunar/Mars settlements (ISRU adaptation & deployment)
3. Lunar/Mars → return data/products → Earth improvement

Financial projections are recalculated conservatively, assuming self-funding after 2029–2030 and modest space-phase investment post-2050.
