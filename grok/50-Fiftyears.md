## 1. Roadmap Overview

The Genesis Network roadmap integrates NASA/ISS-derived technologies (e.g., ECLSS closed-loop life support, Veggie hydroponics, water recycling, radiation shielding) into Earth hubs, creating feedback loops:  
- **Space → Earth**: ISS experiments inform pod design (e.g., ECLSS → aquaponics closure)  
- **Earth → Space**: Hub optimizations (data moat, ceramics) enable lunar factories, Mars settlements  
- **Space → Earth**: Lunar/Mars data refines Earth resilience (e.g., radiation shielding, low-gravity ceramics)

**Key NASA/ISS Tech Sources**  
- ECLSS (Environmental Control and Life Support System) → water/air closure  
- Veggie/BLSS (Bioregenerative Life Support Systems) → aquaponics/multi-trophic  
- Radiation shielding (water bladders, polyethylene) → tile-embedded bladders  
- Closed-loop food production → staggered cycles, microbial inoculants  
- Sensor/data protocols → hyper-dense monitoring
