# Earth-Star Industries Tiles and Kits Catalog

This catalog details all tiles and kits used by Earth-Star Industries for constructing smart city districts, undersea cities, military bases, airports, ships, and aircraft, as outlined in the National Transformation Strategy and Undersea Cities Strategy. All tiles and kits are manufactured in Earth-Star Industries’ tile factories, using recycled materials from landfills, brownfields, coastal infrastructure, and ocean plastics. Construction adheres to smart city standards (ISO 37122), sustainable building codes (LEED Gold, WELL Silver, Green Star 5 Star, BREEAM Excellent, ASHRAE 90.1, 62.1, ICC 500, NFPA 101), military standards (UFC 4-010-01, 3-340-02, 3-410-01, 3-401-01, MIL-STD-810H, 461G, 188-125-1, 1474E, NIST 800-53), and marine standards (ISO 13624-1, DNV-OS-E402, API RP 2A-WSD). Smart airlocks (AI-driven, facial recognition, role-based access, weapons/explosives scanning, instant alerts, ISO 37122, NIST 800-53) are integrated into all buildings for security. Costs and revenues are computed for 2025 technologies, leveraging federal funding (IIJA, CERCLA, IRA, NOAA, DoD), carbon markets ($50–100/ton CO₂), and renewable energy credits (RECs: $20–50/MWh). Enhancements reduce bottlenecks and improve viability.

## Tiles
All tiles are ceramic-based, modular, and produced in tile factories using automated processes. Input materials are sourced from recycled landfill waste (70%), brownfields (20%), ocean plastics/metals (5%), and sustainable mines (5% for SiC, Al₂O₃, graphene/CNTs, ZrO₂).

### Tile Types

### Manufacturing Process
- **Input Processing**: Recycled materials (landfills, brownfields, ocean plastics) shredded, sorted, and chemically treated (electrodialysis, acid leaching) to extract SiC, Al₂O₃, graphene/CNTs, ZrO₂ (80% yield). Sustainable mines supplement shortages.
- **Tile Production**: Raw materials undergo ball milling (24 hours), spray drying, isostatic pressing (200 MPa), and sintering (1,600°C, 95% energy from solar/biogas). IoT sensors, PV cells, AWG units, and LFP batteries integrated via robotic assembly (ABB, 95% automation). Stealth tiles add vacuum-deposited metamaterials; transparent tiles use ALON polishing.
- **Output**: 1M tiles/day/factory (100 factories by 2040). Waste: 5% recycled back into process.
- **Cost Efficiency**: 70% recycled inputs reduce costs by 30% ($3/tile savings). Automation cuts labor by 80% ($1B/year savings).
