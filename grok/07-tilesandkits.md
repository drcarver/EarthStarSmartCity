# Earth-Star Industries: Comprehensive Tiles and Kits Catalog

This catalog compiles all tiles and modular kits from Earth-Star Industries initiatives (Facility, Skyscraper Farm, Smart City Complex, National Strategy, Undersea Cities). All are produced in-house at the tile factory using waste-derived feedstocks (zero material cost via recycling/landfill mining: MSW, e-waste, sewage, landfill leachate). Manufacturing: Automated lines (CVD for graphene/CNTs at 900–1,000°C methane feedstock; HIP sintering at 1,600–1,800°C, 80–150 MPa; microchannel etching 0.5 mm). 95% recyclability via supercritical CO₂/waste-to-energy. Enhancements for viability: 95% AI automation reduces labor 80%; modular snap-together (DARPA BlockADE) cuts assembly time 50%; sales to external markets (e.g., DoD for stealth, NOAA for ocean kits) boost revenue 20%. All buildings constructed solely from tiles, ceramics, and kits; include smart airlocks (facial/role-based, AI scans for weapons/explosives, ISO 37122/NIST 800-53 alerts). Supports sustainable codes (LEED Platinum, WELL Silver, Green Star 5 Star, BREEAM Excellent, ASHRAE 90.1/62.1, ICC 500, NFPA 101; UN SDGs 3/6/7/11/12/14).

## Tiles
All tiles (5 m², 10–15 cm thick facade/floors, 50 cm foundation; 200 kg) form smart grids when assembled. Inputs: Recycled SiC/Al₂O₃ (pyrolysis/electrodialysis), graphene/CNTs (CVD from methane), ZrO₂ (leaching). Composition base: 60% SiC, 25% Al₂O₃, 10% graphene/CNTs, 5% ZrO₂ (2,800 MPa compressive, 700–900 MPa flexural, >95% recyclability). Costs: $10/tile production (energy/labor only); revenues from sales/export.
