# Earth-Star Industries Tiles and Kits Catalog

This document provides a self-contained catalog of all Enhanced Ceramic Tiles and modular kits developed across Earth-Star Industries projects (Prompts 1–7). All items are manufactured in-house at the tile factory using closed-loop processes from waste streams (landfill/brownfield mining: MSW/e-waste/sewage yielding SiC/Al₂O₃/graphene/CNTs/ZrO₂ at ~$0/ton via pyrolysis/electrolysis/supercritical CO₂). Manufacturing: CVD (900–1,000°C, methane feedstock for graphene/CNTs, >90% purity), HIP (1,600–1,800°C, 80–150 MPa for densification), and 3D-printed microchannels (0.5 mm). Compositions: Fiber-reinforced ceramic composites (base: 60% SiC, 25% Al₂O₃, 10% graphene/CNTs, 5% ZrO₂; 2,800 MPa compressive, 700–900 MPa flexural, 20–30 MPa·m¹/² toughness; >95% recyclable). Costs: Recomputed for Nov 10, 2025 (6% inflation from 2024 baselines; waste offsets 50%). Revenues: Aggressive potentials (20% market capture, 15% CAGR). All buildings use these exclusively with smart airlocks (ISO 37122/NIST 800-53; AI scans for weapons/explosives). Enhances viability: Modular snap-together reduces bottlenecks 80%; external sales diversify revenue. New kits: Universal Airlock Kit (integrated security), Waste-to-Feedstock Kit (mining optimizer).

## Enhanced Ceramic Tiles
All variants: 5 m² each, 200 kg, 10–15 cm thick (50 cm foundations); deploy via DARPA canisters. Inputs: Waste pyrolysis (plastics to biochar/graphene), electrodialysis (metals to SiC/Al₂O₃), supercritical CO₂ (recycling). Revenue: $50–100M/year external sales (construction market $10T global).
