# Earth-Star TerraFab  
**Authoritative Final Specification – Version 2.0**  
**All prior Prompt 3 visions, 30 Nov 2025 Addendum claims, and any earlier statements are permanently superseded**  
**First commercial node start:** Construction FID no earlier than Q3 2035 (post Genesis-1 cash-flow positive)

## Core Mission (Corrected & Locked)
Construct and operate a U.S.-based, CHIPS-Act-funded, export-control-compliant advanced semiconductor + pharmaceutical + medical-device campus built predominantly from Genesis Facility ceramic kits and TerraBot construction, co-located (but physically segregated) with Genesis factories and Skyscraper Farms.

Each mature TerraFab node shall, at full ramp (2043+):
- Produce **80,000 × 300 mm wafers/year** at a **12–14 nm** DUV-only node for AI, automotive, and defense customers
- Manufacture **5–7 high-volume, non-scheduled generic APIs** (≤8 t/year total) and repackage finished-dose generics
- Produce **35–40 million units/year** of sustainable medical devices and consumables using Genesis ceramics where possible
- Remain fully sensorised and third-party verifiable via the Earth-Star Central AI & Compliance Portal (CHIPS, FDA, DEA, BIS, SEMI, ICH reporting)

1. Process node → **12–14 nm DUV-only** (7 nm without EUV permanently deleted)  
2. Capacity → **80,000 wafers/year maximum** under realistic CHIPS award  
3. 3D-printing & kits → **≤8 %** of total mass, **zero** in ISO 5–7 or wafer-path zones  
4. Campus separation → **≥800 m** between semiconductor and any pharma/food zones (BIS/CHIPS/FDA requirement)  
5. Energy → Net **import** ~200 GWh/year offset via solar + PPAs; all “net export” claims permanently withdrawn  
6. Pharma → Only **non-scheduled, high-volume generics** (≤8 t/year total) + repackaging; no Schedule I/II, no biologics, no full vertical API independence  
7. Refractory/kiln integration → Limited to Genesis ceramic cladding and kiln furniture only (<1.8 % of fab mass)  
8. Timeline → First wafer **Q4 2041**, full ramp **2043**  
9. CapEx → **$11.8–$13.4 billion** gross (aligned with real U.S. greenfield 10–14 nm projects)
