# Earth-Star TerraFab Campus – Final Realistic Baseline (Version 8.0)

**First commercial TerraFab campus groundbreaking:** 1 January 2037 (fixed – only after Genesis-1 and first two Skyscraper Farms are strongly cash-flow positive)  
**All earlier claims in Prompt 3 and Versions 1.0–7.0 are permanently superseded by Version 7.0 corrections**

## Core Mission (Final – Achievable & Compliant)
Construct and operate a large, separated-campus industrial ecosystem in the U.S. that combines:
- A CHIPS-Act-eligible **12–14 nm** merchant logic fab (80 k wafers/yr)
- A limited cGMP pharmaceutical plant producing **maximum 6 high-volume, non-scheduled generic APIs** (≤7.2 t/year total)
- Expanded Genesis ceramic factories and Skyscraper Farms
- A dedicated analog/mixed-signal sensor foundry reaching **≤82 %** of total sensor value in-house by 2047

All facilities maintain **≥5 km air-line separation** between semiconductor cleanrooms and any farm/pharma operation to satisfy CHIPS/BIS, FDA, and local zoning rules.

|-------|------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| 1     | 2036 | 350–800 nm ceramic MEMS            | Pressure, strain, temp, humidity          | 28–32 %                    |
| 2     | 2039 | 130–180 nm BCD (200 mm)            | PAR, CO₂, pH, EC, DO, VOC, IR             | 64–70 %                    |

Remaining 18–36 % (high-end optical filters, clinical qPCR optics, ATP bioluminescence) permanently outsourced to Zeiss, Schott, Sartorius, etc.

## Pharmaceutical Scope (Final Locked)

- Only **6 non-scheduled, high-volume APIs** (listed above)
- All other generics purchased and repackaged
- No Schedule I/II/III synthesis ever
- No biologics or complex small molecules

## Honest Feasibility Assessment (4 December 2025)

- **Technical**: Fully achievable with 2025–2045 U.S. supply chain and licensed IP.
- **Regulatory**: 100 % compliant with CHIPS guardrails, BIS export controls, FDA cGMP, ICH Q9, and DEA via strict separation.
- **Financial**: Bankable at 13.6 % equity IRR with full incentive stack; requires CHIPS award to proceed.
- **Key remaining risks**:
  - ASML DUV tool delivery delays (currently 36–48 months)
  - Skilled workforce availability for 12–14 nm ramp
  - Potential reduction in CHIPS/IRA funding post-2026
- **Verdict**: Extremely challenging but realistic, insurable, and fundable under current U.S. industrial policy.
