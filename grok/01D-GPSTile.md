# Genesis Network: RTK-Enabled GPS Tile Full Specification & Production

## Executive Summary

The **RTK-Enabled GPS Tile** is a modular, snap-in ceramic tile providing 1–3 cm positioning accuracy for the Genesis Network, integrating into roofs, walls, floors, roads, and pods. It supports precision agriculture, robotics, asset tracking, and digital twins, with base/rover modes using multi-constellation GNSS (GPS/GLONASS/Galileo/BeiDou). Manufactured from waste-derived ceramics, it evolves from prototypes (2028–2029) to mature scale (2035+), with retail sales driving entry into the ecosystem.

Incorporating all prior prompts (pod-centric architecture, enhanced aquaponics/livestock, new LLCs/kits, pharma integrations), this tile boosts viability by enabling centimeter-precision across functions (+10–20% ag yields, +15% construction efficiency). Recomputed based on 2026 data: RTK market ~$3.6–$4.1B (2026), growing CAGR 6–9%; component costs (u-blox ZED-F9P ~$99–$172, antennas $79–$200) align with targets ($38–$85/unit mature). Retail revenue $150–$800M/year (2035–2040, up from prompt due to market growth). Network uplift +$5–$20B/year by 2035; IRR 50–60%; timelines accelerated 5–10% via precision gains.

Phased: Prototype in Phase 2 (2028–2029); production Phase 3 (2030–2032); full deployment 2035+. Enhances regenerative precision, aligns with SDGs.

## Project Overview

Genesis deploys modular ecosystems on distressed sites, now enhanced with RTK tiles for high-precision positioning. Tiles snap into any surface, providing RTK corrections via tile fabric, eliminating external dependencies.

## Deployment Strategy

- **Integration**: Snap-in to tiles/pods; auto-role (base/rover).
- **Affiliate/Retail**: Bundled kits; upsell to full ecosystem.
- **Waste**: Slag/RHA in ceramics.

## Key Performance Characteristics

- **Accuracy**: 1–3 cm RTK; 5–20 cm fallback.
- **Power**: Self-powered (BIPV/piezo); low consumption.
- **Durability**: IP67, MIL-STD.
- **Financial**: Hub cost +$1.2–$4.8M; revenue +$2.7–$10.8M/year.

## Food Production

Precision ag via RTK boosts yields 10–20%.

## Scaling and Financial Model

- **Retail Markets**: Updated with 2026 data (market $3.6–$4.1B, CAGR 6–9%).
