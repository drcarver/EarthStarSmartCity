## 1. Objective & Strategic Integration

Integrate **grocery, liquor, home & garden retail** with **AI-assisted modular sensors** into Genesis hubs, leveraging **Prism module deployment**, **SUC lifecycle**, and **digital twin simulation** — while adhering to **ultra-rapid bootstrap** and **revenue-first** priorities.

This consolidated model supersedes prior prompts, focusing on high-margin early retail (produce/dairy/eggs/honey) expanding to full retail, with all sensors as Prism modules for rapid, rollback-safe integration.

## 2. Core Principles (Enforced Doctrine)

1. **Ultra-Rapid Alignment**: Retail/sensors post-bootstrap gates (Month 3–6).  
2. **AI-Assisted Sensors**: All (RTK/environmental/ag/bio/security) as Prism modules with partial classes, auto-tests, SUC manifests.  
3. **Digital Twin Simulation**: Model energy/water/yield/resiliency pre-deployment.  
4. **Phased Retail**: High-margin pilots first; full grocery/liquor/home & garden later.  
5. **Sovereign/Privacy-First**: Prism host + SUC for modular updates/privacy.  
6. **Cultural Compliance**: Halal/kosher/region-specific variants.  
7. **Resource Simulation**: Twins + climate data drive planning.
