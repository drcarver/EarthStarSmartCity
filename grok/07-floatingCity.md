# Earth-Star Industries Floating City

This document describes the Earth-Star Industries Floating City, a mobile, domed urban platform extending the undersea and smart city initiatives. Constructed on a buoyant ceramic-composite platform (1 km² base, 15-floor domed city for 20,000 residents), it features electric propulsion engines for global mobility (20 knots, 10,000 nm range) and integrated ocean regeneration systems (plastic filtration, nutrient dosing for algal blooms reversal). The full dome (transparent tiles, 150m height) enables stargazing and marine views, functioning as a reverse aquarium while protecting against Category 5 storms (ICC 500/MIL-STD-810H). All structures use Enhanced Ceramic Tiles and Smart Studs (per Prompt 1; inflated 6% for 2025 maritime adaptations). Platform: Graphene-reinforced ceramic hull (2,800 MPa strength, >95% recyclable). Regeneration: Processes 1 km²/hour seawater (removes 10 tons plastics/day, restores pH/nutrients per NOAA standards). Off-grid: 2 GW power (tidal/solar/wind). Ties to national strategy via hyperloop docking and fingerling release (100M/year). Compliance: ISO 37122/27001 (smart maritime); LEED Platinum (floating); WELL Platinum; Green Star 6 Star; BREEAM Outstanding; ASHRAE 90.1/62.1 (marine HVAC); UN SDGs 6/11/13/14; EPA CWA (zero discharge). Security: Smart airlocks (ISO 37122/NIST 800-53). Automation: 95% (Boston Dynamics Spot/ROVs, DARPA Squad X). New kits: Floating Platform Kit, Propulsion Engine Kit, Ocean Regeneration Kit. Scalable to 100 cities by 2040 ($1T/year revenue from mobility/tourism/regeneration services).

## Project Overview
A 1 km² floating platform (150m draft, 50,000-ton displacement) supports a domed city mirroring the Smart City Complex (homes, hospital, school, mall, farms, industrial/data centers, airport/hyperloop port). Mobility: 4 electric azimuth thrusters (20 knots, electric from LFP batteries/tidal). Regeneration: Hull-integrated filters (ceramic membranes, 1 km²/hour intake; AI-optimized dosing for ocean health). Housing: 5,000 luxury units (ocean-view). Tourism: 10,000 visitors/day ($1,000/ticket, $143B ocean market share). Research: Marine labs (coral/fingerling integration). Location: Global (U.S. coasts initial; hyperloop/subsea links).
