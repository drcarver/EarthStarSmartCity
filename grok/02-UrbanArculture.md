## Introduction

The Earth-Star Industries Sustainable Urban Agriculture System Kit is a household-scale, closed-loop solution designed for a U.S. urban setting (e.g., Seattle or Miami), serving a household of 4-6 people. Housed in a 300-500 ft² sunroom, it integrates advanced waste management, water recycling, energy generation, food production, and recreational features (in-ground pool, hot tub, sauna, outdoor kitchen). The system processes sewage, organic and non-organic municipal solid waste (MSW), and greywater, producing food, energy, water, and construction tiles while capturing CO₂. Built entirely from enhanced ceramic tiles, smart studs, and modular kits sourced from Earth-Star Industries tile factories, it leverages solar, biogas, geothermal, aligning with green building codes (e.g., LEED Gold, ASHRAE 90.1).

This kit reuses existing Tile, Stud, and Amenity Kits from the Earth-Star Industries Facility Project, introducing new kits (Sunroom Kit, Agriculture Kit, Waste Processing Kit) to streamline assembly. Costs and revenues are recomputed for 2025 technology, incorporating suggestions to enhance viability (e.g., subsidies, modular scalability, automation). All equipment, including bio-digesters, AWGs, TCPS, WTE, and HVAC, is fabricated from ceramics, tiles, and kits only, with smart airlocks integrated for security per ISO 37122 smart city standards.
