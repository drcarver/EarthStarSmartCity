# Earth-Star Skyscraper Farm  
**Authoritative Final Specification – Version 1.1**  
**All previous claims superseded by Locked Realism Corrections below**  
**Project start date (first commercial node):** 2 January 2032 – 100 % fixed

## Core Mission (Corrected & Locked)
Construct and operate a rapidly replicating network of highly automated Skyscraper Farms built predominantly from flat-pack kits manufactured by the Genesis Facility ecosystem.

Each mature node shall:
- Feed **5,300–6,200 people** year-round with complete USDA MyPlate dietary diversity including premium freshwater/brackish fish and shrimp
- Generate **$52–$78 million** annual free cash flow after all costs at steady-state
- Be **net exporter of electricity** in high-insolation climates only; **net exporter of potable water** in humid climates only
- Achieve **≥98 % closed-loop** performance for water and nutrients (commercial best-practice 2025–2035)
- Produce **≥85 %** of its own seed and freshwater/brackish broodstock; marine salmon deleted
- Sell **maximum 60 %** of annual ModuGreenhouse-01 production externally at full margin (resolves food-vs-sales conflict)
- Maintain continuous, real-time, third-party-verifiable compliance via the Earth-Star Central AI & Compliance Portal
- Colocate with Genesis plants when possible

## Locked Realism Corrections – Version 1.1 (Binding – Supersede All Prior Claims)

1. People fed per node → **5,300–6,200** (realistic maximum with 100 % own-use of CEA area)  
2. Net exports → Electricity: high-insolation only; Water: humid climates only; Oxygen export claim **permanently deleted**  
3. Circularity → **≥98 %** water & nutrients (2025 commercial best practice)  
4. In-house manufacturing → **≥92 % of total value** from Genesis ecosystem; steel, LEDs, HVAC, pumps, controls remain licensed third-party  
5. Labor → **≤10 full-time equivalents** per node (maintenance, hatchery, regulatory); zero routine labor in crop zones where legally permissible  
6. ModuGreenhouse-01 external sales → **Maximum 60 %** of annual production (resolves food-vs-sales conflict)  
7. Turnkey pricing → **$680–$780 per m²** (real 2025–2035 European/Dutch benchmark)  
8. Fish species → Freshwater/brackish only (tilapia, barramundi, shrimp); marine salmon & 100 % broodstock independence **deleted until ≥2045**  
9. Total footprint → **4,300 ± 400 hectares** including all buffers and infrastructure  

All other specifications in Prompt 2 remain unchanged except where explicitly corrected above.
