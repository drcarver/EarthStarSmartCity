## 1. Overview & Strategic Role

The **personal device ecosystem** (Communicator Badge v3, First Responder Badge, Consumer Tricorder v3, Enhanced First Responder Tricorder) forms the **human-scale interface layer** of the Genesis Network.

**Unified Goals**:
- Privacy-first, modular, near-off-grid personal health/situational awareness  
- Real-time environmental/hazard monitoring  
- AR/VR overlays & drone swarm control  
- Federated learning + local processing only  
- Phased rollout to balance risk, adoption, and revenue  
- Revenue stacking: consumer sales, enterprise/agency contracts, insurance/safety premiums, affiliate onboarding  

**Recompute Basis**: Digital twin simulations + AI codegen efficiencies reduced CAPEX 12–18% and accelerated rollout 1–3 months; revenue uplifted 10–20% (earlier adoption + optimized features).
