## Objective

Large-scale smart display walls, constructed from modular **Smart Furniture Surface Tiles** (and outdoor-hardened variants), transform passive building façades, community plazas, retail fronts, tower exteriors, TerraWell centers, public spaces, and internal surfaces into dynamic, interactive, revenue-generating infrastructure. These walls deliver high-resolution displays, free public WiFi, embedded compute/storage for local AI, and self-powering/resource generation — all while integrating seamlessly with the Genesis Network's closed-loop ecosystem, dense sensor nets, digital twins, smart city standards, and sustainable building codes.

Core goals:  
- Enable multi-user interactive AI queries and content  
- Provide secure, free public WiFi hotspots  
- Embed hot-swappable compute/storage for edge services and federated learning  
- Achieve zero-grid dependency via BIPV solar + piezoelectric harvesting + AWG cooling  
- Generate revenue through advertising, data services, broadband, and compute leasing

- **Community Hubs & Plazas** → Public information walls (sequestration data, events), civic engagement, free broadband hotspots  
- **TerraWell Centers** → Offline health education content, telehealth query walls, free WiFi for patients/visitors. Provide movie theaters with food and drink service. All furniture includes smart tiles. Provide free WiFi.
- **Tower Buildings** → Full-height media skins doubling as edge compute clusters for hub-wide AI services  
- **Public Spaces** → Wayfinding, emergency alerts, tourism info, broadband access points  

## Viability & Integration Notes

Large-scale smart display walls convert passive architectural surfaces into active, revenue-generating assets while preserving the Network’s core principles of modularity, self-powering (BIPV/piezo/AWG cooling), and closed-loop resource use. They align with smart city standards (ISO/TC 268), sustainable building codes (ISO 14001), and the Genesis data moat (local digital twins optimize content delivery and load balancing). Deployment occurs exclusively on private Network/affiliate land, minimizing regulatory burden. Public WiFi complies with FCC guest network guidelines (isolated, time/session-limited). The combination of interactive AI, free broadband, and edge compute creates strong community value, monetization flywheel, and social/political goodwill.
