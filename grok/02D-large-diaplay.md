# Genesis Network Smart Display Walls: Executive Summary

The **Genesis Network** deploys large-scale smart display walls from snap-together Smart Furniture Surface Tiles (indoor/outdoor variants), transforming surfaces into interactive, revenue-generating infrastructure. Walls feature high-resolution MicroLED/OLED displays (sunlight-readable), multi-user touch, local AI queries (small LLMs), public WiFi hotspots (WiFi 6/7, isolated), and hot-swappable compute/storage for edge services. Self-powered via BIPV (80–220 Wp/m²), piezo (2–15 W/m²), and AWG microchannel cooling; full integration with tile fabric, digital twins, and standards.

Recomputed timelines (Jan 31, 2026 baseline): Prototypes 2027; scaled deployment 2028–2030; mature 2035+. Costs: $335–755/m² mature (down 10–15% via volume/ceramics). Revenues: $170–630/m²/year (ads/broadband/leasing). Network potential (2060+): 50–150M m² → $8.5–94.5B/year. IRR: 50–70%; payback 1–3 years; viability: 9/10 (+15–30% from monetization/goodwill).

# Project Overview

Walls convert façades/plazas/retail/towers into dynamic assets with interactive AI, free secure WiFi, and embedded compute. Manufactured from waste-derived ceramics; modular snap assembly. Use cases: Retail showcases, community info, TerraWell education, public broadband. Aligns with regenerative principles: Self-powered, closed-loop, local twins for content/privacy.

## Key Performance Characteristics
- **Display**: 4K–8K/10m²; 2,000–4,000 nits outdoor.
- **Interaction**: Multi-touch, voice, local LLM queries.
- **WiFi**: 100–500 Mbps/10m²; WPA3 isolated.
- **Compute**: 1–10 TFLOPS/10m²; hot-swappable.
- **Power**: Near-zero grid; surplus export.
- **Financial**: $170–630/m²/year revenue.

# Core Principles
- Modular Tiles: Snap-together; hot-swappable.
- Self-Powered: BIPV/piezo/AWG cooling.
- Local-First AI: Privacy via twins; federated.
- Regenerative: 70–95% waste-derived.
- Community Value: Free WiFi/info; goodwill.
- Standards: ISO/TC 268, ISO 14001.

# Key Products and Outputs
1. **Display Walls**: Indoor/outdoor from furniture tiles.
2. **Features**: Interactive AI, WiFi hotspots, compute/storage.
3. **Content**: Dynamic ads/info/queries.
4. **Networking**: Waveguide/inductive integration.
5. **Upgrades**: Swappable modules for evolution.

# Sensors and Digital Twins
Embedded sensors for touch/thermal; twins optimize content/load. Standards: IEEE 2030, ITU-T Y.4900.

# Education & Training
Dojo for wall management; free public interaction guides.

# Housing, Schools, Hospitals
Walls in TerraWell/community for education/WiFi.

# Deployment Strategy
- **Sites**: Façades/plazas/towers; private land.
- **Affiliates**: Subsidized walls for retail.
- **Phased**: Core indoor → outdoor/full-featured.

# Food Production
Showcases produce availability; drives sales.

# Scaling and Financial Model
- **Revenues**: $170–630/m²/year (ads 40%, broadband 20%, leasing 40%).
- **Model**: Payback 1–3 years; IRR 50–70%.

# Detailed Phased Implementation Plan (Recomputed)
2027 prototypes; costs down via volume; revenues up 10–20% from engagement.

## Phase 1: Core Indoor (2027–2029)
- Basic displays/AI queries.
- CAPEX: $100–250/m² deployed. Revenue: $100–300/m²/year.

## Phase 2: Outdoor/Scaled (2030–2034)
- Hardened + WiFi/compute.
- CAPEX Addition: $150–400/m². Revenue Uplift: +$200–500/m²/year.

## Phase 3: Mature/Full (2035–2060+)
- 50–150M m²; max features.
- CAPEX: $5–15B network. Revenue: $8.5–94.5B/year. Net: +$5–50B.

| Phase | Years | Deployed Area (M m² network) | CAPEX ($B network) | Revenue ($B/year end) |
|-------|-------|------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| 1     | 2027–29 | 1–5                         | 0.5–1.5           | 0.1–1.5              |
| 2     | 2030–34 | 10–50                       | 2–6               | 2–25                 |
| 3     | 2035–60+ | 50–150                      | 5–15              | 8.5–94.5             |

# Land Acquisition
