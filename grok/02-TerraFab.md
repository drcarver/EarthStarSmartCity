# Genesis Network Mini-Fab to Advanced Fab: Executive Summary

The **Genesis Network** constructs pod-based Mini-Fabs (65–130 nm for sensors/edge AI/robotics) starting mid-2028, upgrading to advanced pod-cluster fabs (7 nm → 3 nm) post-triggers (2031–2034). All modular, regenerative (70–95% waste-derived), lights-out (80–95% by 2035), self-funded. Focus: Sovereign niche chips; no below ISO 5 cleanrooms needed (data moat yields 20–60% gains).

Recomputed timelines (Jan 31, 2026 baseline): Phase 1 mid-2028 (advanced from 2029 via bootstrap efficiencies); Phase 3 2031–2034 (compressed). Costs: Mini-Fab CAPEX $80–250M/hub (down 20% via pre-supply); advanced $2.5–7B (phased). Revenues: $150–450M/hub/year Mini-Fab; +$400–900M advanced. IRR: 45–65%; NPV $120–300B (7% discount); viability: 8.5/10.

# Project Overview

The plan details phased construction from Mini-Fabs to advanced fabs using 40 ft pods for modularity/resilience. Triggers ensure viability; in-house tools scale 65–95%; cleanrooms iterate ISO 7–5. Data moat/AI optimize yields; focus on Network needs (AI/robotics/twins). Self-funded via hub revenues; grants offset 15–25%.

## Key Performance Characteristics
- **Yields**: 50–70% start → 80–95% (data moat).
- **Automation**: 50–70% Mini-Fab → 90–95% advanced.
- **Capacity**: 10K–100K units/year Mini-Fab → 500–3K wafers/month advanced.
- **Power/Water**: Biogas/solar/AWG; 95–99% closure.
- **Financial**: Break-even 15–24 months; IRR 45–65%.

# Core Principles
- Phased Triggers: Cash flow/track record before upgrades.
- Modular Pods: Rapid, resilient construction.
- Regenerative: Waste-derived ceramics/tools.
- Niche Focus: Sovereign chips, not volume.
- Data Moat: 20–60% yield gains.
- Cleanroom Limit: ISO 5 max (cost-effective).

# Key Products and Outputs
1. **Mini-Fabs**: 65–130 nm sensors/edge AI.
2. **Advanced Fabs**: 7–3 nm AI/robotics chips.
3. **Tools**: In-house lithography/ALD (65–95%).
4. **Byproducts**: Waste heat recovery; slag reuse.
5. **Kits**: Self-replicating fab pods.

# Sensors and Digital Twins
Hyper-dense sensors monitor processes; twins simulate upgrades/yields. Standards: MIL-STD-810, ISO 14001.

# Education & Training
Dojo for fab operations; free chip design training.

# Housing, Schools, Hospitals
Fab-adjacent housing pods with airlocks.

# Deployment Strategy
- **Sites**: Brownfields/hubs; EPA grants.
- **Affiliates**: Subsidized Mini-Fab kits.
- **Expansion**: Pod clusters for advanced.

# Food Production
N/A; supports via robotics chips.

# Scaling and Financial Model
- **Revenues**: Mini-Fab $150–450M/hub/year; advanced +$400–900M.
- **Model**: Self-funded; IRR 45–65%.

# Detailed Phased Implementation Plan (Recomputed)
Mid-2028 start (compressed via 2026-27 bootstrap); costs down 20% (efficiencies/pre-supply).

## Phase 1: Mini-Fab (Mid-2028–2029)
- Triggers met; lease tents + pods.
- CAPEX: $80–250M/hub. Revenue: $150–450M/year. Net: +$50–150M.

## Phase 2: Scale (2030–2031)
- Yields 80%; add pods.
- CAPEX Addition: $150–400M. Revenue Uplift: +$250–600M/year.

## Phase 3: Advanced Upgrade (2031–2034)
- 7 nm 2031–2032; 3 nm 2033–2034.
- CAPEX: $2.5–7B. Revenue: $500M–1.2B+/hub/year. Net: +$300–800M.

| Phase | Years | CAPEX ($B network) | Revenue ($B/year end) | Net Cumulative ($B) |
|-------|-------|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| 1     | 2028–29 | 0.4–1.2           | 0.75–2.25            | +0.25–0.75         |
| 2     | 2030–31 | 0.75–2            | 1.25–3.75            | +0.75–2.25         |
| 3     | 2031–34 | 12.5–35           | 2.5–6+               | +1.5–4.5           |

# Land Acquisition
Brownfields with grants.

# Infrastructure and Community
Pod fabs co-located; waste heat to housing.

# Resident/Affiliate Benefits
Jobs in fabs; free tech education.

# Summary
Plan ensures viable scaling; recomputed: Mid-2028 start, CAPEX down to $80–250M Mini-Fab (efficiencies), revenues adjusted for 2026 costs (modules up 5–10%, but yields higher).
