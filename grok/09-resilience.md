## Bottom-Line Resilience Statement
A single MHUE-50k city is the most disaster-resilient human settlement ever designed with 2025 technology.  
The full 7,200-city network is effectively extinction-proof against every known natural or man-made disaster short of a 10+ km asteroid or gamma-ray burst.

In the absolute worst-case 5,500-warhead nuclear war + 20-year nuclear winter scenario, the Earth-Star network loses <6 % of nodes to direct blasts, then sustains the entire surviving U.S. population indefinitely with zero external input while the planet slowly recovers.

No other proposed 21st-century urban system even approaches this resilience profile.
