### Conclusion
A single Earth-Star domed district built with 2025 ceramic tiles is already **the most survivable human habitat ever designed** — more resilient than Cheyenne Mountain, more autonomous than the ISS, and capable of preserving technological civilization through every plausible existential threat except a direct >10 km asteroid strike or nearby supernova.

When 23,200 districts exist by 2060, humanity effectively becomes **extinction-proof** using nothing more than recycled garbage and 2025 technology.
