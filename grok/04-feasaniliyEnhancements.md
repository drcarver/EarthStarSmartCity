## Introduction & Overall Impact

This enhancement package raises the base-case success probability from ~20–32% to **28–45%+** by systematically addressing critical failure modes through actionable, low-regret strategies. Total estimated uplift: +8–13% (conservative aggregation of category impacts). Optimistic case: 50–70% with perfect execution.

Incremental CAPEX: <$500M network-wide (mostly compliance, stockpiles, incentives — funded from early tile/food/biogas revenue). Revenue impact: Positive (+$200–800M/year from faster permitting, affiliate growth, goodwill). IRR sensitivity: Improves baseline by +5–12% (45–75% → 50–87%).
