## 1. Objective & Target Impact

Implement a realistic, low-regret enhancement package to meaningfully increase project success probability from **~20–32%** to **28–45%+** (base case) and **50–70%** (optimistic case) by addressing remaining critical failure modes: regulatory delays, political opposition, talent burnout, supply chain fragility, black-swan exposure, and early execution risks.

**Constraints**:
- Executable within 2026–2030 bootstrap window  
- Leverages existing strengths (modular hubs, data moat, farmer empowerment, TerraWell goodwill)  
- No new major risks or dependencies  
- Strict self-funding after bootstrap (no equity raises, no long-term public funding)  
- Incremental CAPEX <$500M network-wide

**Total Incremental CAPEX**: **$258–$610M** network-wide (2026–2030) — funded from early tile/food/biogas revenue  
**IRR Sensitivity**: Maintains or improves baseline (45–75%) due to faster permitting, talent retention, and affiliate scaling  
**Highest-ROI Enhancements**: Farmer co-op refinements, TerraWell visibility, pre-supply staging, cash reserve target  

**Prioritized Implementation Order** (2026–2028 focus):
1. Regulatory acceleration + farmer co-op refinements (fastest political/regulatory uplift)  
2. Pre-supply staging + critical component stockpiling (supply chain defense)  
3. TerraWell visibility + profit-share incentives (talent + goodwill)  
4. Black-swan hardening + cash reserve build (macro resilience)  
5. Contingency planning + affiliate fallback (execution safety net)
