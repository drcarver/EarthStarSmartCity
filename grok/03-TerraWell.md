# TerraWell FreeCare System: Detailed Specification

**Version Date:** December 2025

## 1. Executive Summary

The **TerraWell FreeCare System**, operated exclusively by the independent TerraWell Foundation (a private 501(c)(3) nonprofit), provides 100% free healthcare, food, durable medical equipment (DME), and related services to underserved populations on or near Genesis Network brownfield/MSW-processing sites. All services require no identification, means testing, or payment.

**Mission**: Deliver immediate humanitarian relief and long-term health equity in distressed communities through regenerative-site infrastructure, focusing on food security, basic medical care, mental health support, and accessible DME.

**Scale Goals (2050 Targets)**:
- 500 fixed FreeCare centers (pod-based clinics on brownfields).
- 2,000 mobile units (truck/pod trailers for outreach/disaster response).
- Annual reach: 20–30 million individuals (food distributions, visits, DME).
- Training: 100,000+ competency completions/year via education modules.

**Net Financial Impact to EarthStar Technologies**:
- EarthStar donates qualifying tangible inventory (food, OTC medications, 3D-printed DME) at fair market value (FMV), claiming enhanced deductions under IRC §170(e)(3) (up to 2x cost basis for food; partial for medical supplies used for ill/needy).
- Recalculated annual tax savings: $50–$150M by 2030 (ramping with hub scale), $500M–$2B/year by 2040–2050.
- No direct revenue to TerraWell; full separation ensures compliance. Donations offset EarthStar taxable income while advancing humanitarian goals.

## 2. Legal & Tax Structure Description

The TerraWell Foundation is a standalone 501(c)(3) public charity, incorporated separately from EarthStar Technologies. It maintains strict independence:
- Independent board of directors (no overlapping members with EarthStar).
- Separate EIN, bank accounts, governance, and operations.
- Arm's-length transactions: EarthStar donates tangible inventory at FMV; TerraWell issues contemporaneous written acknowledgments.
- No shared personnel, data, or facilities beyond physical co-location on brownfields (separate entrances/airlocks).
- Funding: 100% from qualifying inventory donations under IRC §170(e)(3); no public grants, service fees, or individual contributions.
- Tax deductions: Enhanced for food (up to 2x cost basis if used for needy); partial (cost + 50% appreciation, capped at 2x) for medical supplies/DME donated for care of ill.
- Compliance: Annual Form 990 filings; no political activity; healthcare services via licensed staff/volunteers.
- No donation of services, intangibles, or "credits."

## 9. Honest Feasibility & Compliance Assessment

**Strengths**:
