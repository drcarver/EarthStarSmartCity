# TerraWell FreeCare System: Executive Specification (December 2025)

## 1. Executive Summary

The **TerraWell FreeCare System**, operated by the independent **TerraWell Foundation** (a 501(c)(3) nonprofit), provides **100% free** primary, urgent, and mental health care, along with essential tangible goods (nutritious food, OTC medications, select 3D-printed durable medical equipment such as wheelchairs/crutches/walkers/CPAP accessories) to any individual in need—no means testing, co-pays, or identification required.

Mission: Advance health equity by delivering barrier-free humanitarian aid to the underserved, aligning with charitable purposes under IRC §501(c)(3).

Scale Goals (2050): Operate 500 fixed centers and 1,000 mobile units co-located on Genesis sites, serving 50–100 million annual patient encounters and distributing goods valued at $10–20B (FMV).

Net Financial Impact to EarthStar Technologies: Enhanced corporate tax deductions under IRC §170(e)(3) for qualifying inventory donations (primarily food; limited for certain medical supplies used for care of the ill/needy), estimated cumulative tax savings of $5–15B by 2050 (conservative; dependent on utilization and IRS substantiation).

## 2. Legal & Tax Structure Description

The TerraWell Foundation operates as a fully independent 501(c)(3) public charity with its own governing board (no overlap with EarthStar personnel). It maintains separate facilities, finances, data systems, and operations. Funding derives exclusively from arm's-length, fair-market-value donations of tangible inventory from EarthStar Technologies and potential unrelated third parties. No public/government funds accepted to preserve flexibility.

Donations qualify for corporate charitable deductions under IRC §170. Enhanced deductions (§170(e)(3)) apply to qualifying food inventory and certain medical supplies/pharmaceuticals used solely for care of the ill, needy, or infants (deduction up to basis + 50% of appreciation, capped at 2x basis; overall corporate limit 10–15% taxable income). Standard deductions (basis or FMV, as applicable) for other DME. All transactions documented with contemporaneous acknowledgments, appraisals (if >$5,000), and IRS Form 8283 compliance.

Medical services funded through charity's operational reserves (generated from prior donations) and volunteer/paid staff compensation—not tied to specific corporate contributions.

## 5. Rollout Timeline 2027–2075

- **2027–2035**: Pilot phase; 10 fixed centers + 50 mobile units; validate operations/compliance.
- **2036–2045**: Expansion; 100 fixed + 300 mobile; integrate with maturing Genesis sites.
- **2046–2060**: National scale; 300 fixed + 700 mobile.
- **2061–2075**: Full maturity; 500 fixed + 1,000 mobile; sustained operations.

Phasing tied to Genesis revenue/donation capacity; conservative to ensure compliance.

## 6. Mobile Unit Detailed Specifications and Disaster Response Protocols

Mobile Units: 40–60 ft modular trailers built with Genesis ceramic tiles; DC-powered (solar/biogas tie-in); hyperspectral screening airlock for non-contact triage (fever, vitals, basic pathogen detection); 4–6 exam rooms; on-board dispensary (secured storage); telehealth-enabled.

Disaster Response: Units deployable within 48 hours via pre-positioning agreements; priority to FEMA/coordinated zones; stockpile essentials (food, OTC, DME); provide free urgent care/goods; coordinate with Red Cross/VOAD; post-event reporting for compliance.

## 7. Political & Reputational Risk Mitigation Analysis

Risks: Perceived corporate influence; scrutiny over tax benefits; regulatory changes.

Mitigations: Strict independence (separate board/operations); transparent annual reporting (Form 990); third-party audits; no political activity; focus on verifiable humanitarian outcomes; contingency for reduced deductions (continue operations via reserves).

Reputational upside: Demonstrates corporate social responsibility; builds public goodwill.

## 8. Strict Integration Rules with Genesis System / EarthStar Technologies

Prohibitions:
- No shared personnel, data, or governance.
- No co-branding or implied affiliation in public materials.
- Donations at fair-market-value only; no services/"credits."
- Separate physical entrances/facilities on shared sites.
- No resident-only access; open to public.
- Arm's-length contracts for construction/materials.

Violations risk private inurement/jeopardize exempt status.

## 9. Honest Feasibility & Compliance Assessment

Strengths: Strong humanitarian alignment; leverages Genesis outputs efficiently; meaningful tax incentives for food (enhanced) and select medical inventory; scalable via modular design.

Risks/Safeguards:
- FDA: OTC/monograph-compliant only; no prescription generics (complex redistribution rules); rigorous chain-of-custody documentation.
- IRS: Enhanced deductions limited (primarily food; partial for medical); require qualified use/substantiation/appraisals.
- Operational: Staffing (volunteer/paid model); liability insurance; HIPAA compliance for care.
- Overall: Highly feasible with disciplined separation; no regulatory immunity—full adherence required. Success hinges on independent governance and conservative claims.
