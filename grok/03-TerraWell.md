# TerraWell FreeCare System  
**Executive Specification Document**  
*December 2025*

## Executive Summary

The **TerraWell FreeCare System** is an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit operated by the TerraWell Foundation, dedicated to providing **100% free** primary, urgent, and mental health care, along with essential medical goods, to anyone in need—no means testing, co-pays, or identification required. Facilities are co-located on Genesis System brownfield sites but remain legally and operationally separate.

**Mission**: Deliver accessible, high-quality humanitarian health services to underserved populations, emphasizing dignity, equity, and immediate relief.

**Scale Goals (2050)**: Operate 500–800 fixed centers and 1,000+ mobile units nationwide, serving 50–100 million patient-visits annually, with emphasis on rural, disaster-prone, and low-income areas.

**Net Financial Impact to EarthStar Technologies**: Enhanced corporate deductions under IRC §170(e)(3) for qualified food inventory (basis + 50% appreciation, capped); standard FMV deductions for certain OTC medications and select DME used solely for care of the ill/needy. Estimated annual tax savings: variable based on donation volume, but grounded in arm's-length FMV transactions.

## Legal & Tax Structure Description

The TerraWell Foundation is a standalone public charity under IRC §501(c)(3), with an independent board of directors unaffiliated with EarthStar Technologies. No shared personnel, data systems, or governance.

Funding derives exclusively from arm's-length donations of tangible inventory from EarthStar Technologies at fair market value (FMV), appraised as required. Donations are limited to qualifying goods under IRC §170(e); no services, labor, or intangible contributions.

Corporate deductions: Primarily §170(e)(3) enhanced for food; standard charitable rules for other qualifying tangible property (e.g., certain medical supplies/DME directly related to care of the ill/needy). No special rules for prescription generics (complex FDA/GMP issues).

Operations funded through charity's general resources (investment income, additional public donations if pursued). Strict firewall ensures no private inurement or excess benefit transactions.

- **2045–2055**: National coverage – 500+ centers + 800 mobiles.
- **2055–2075**: Maturity & sustainment – full network, adaptive upgrades.

Phased based on donation capacity and operational funding.

## Mobile Unit Detailed Specifications and Disaster Response Protocols

**Specs**: 40–50 ft ceramic-tiled trailers; solar/DC-powered; hyperspectral entry screening; 4–6 exam rooms; stocked dispensary; satellite telehealth.

**Disaster Protocols**: Pre-positioned fleets; rapid deployment within 24–48 hours; coordination with FEMA/Red Cross (no direct federal funding); provide immediate triage, goods distribution, mental health support. All services free; no patient data shared.

## Political & Reputational Risk Mitigation Analysis

**Risks**: Perceived corporate influence; scrutiny over tax benefits vs. charity care.

**Mitigations**: Transparent annual reporting (Form 990); independent audits; public disclosure of firewall; emphasis on universal access. Avoid political advocacy; focus on humanitarian neutrality.

## Strict Integration Rules with Genesis System / EarthStar Technologies

**Explicit Prohibitions**:
- No shared board, staff, or data systems.
- No co-branding or implied affiliation.
- Donations at arm's-length FMV only; no bundled services.
- Separate facilities/entry points.
- No preferential access for Genesis residents/workers.
- Independent compliance monitoring.

## Honest Feasibility & Compliance Assessment

**Strengths**: Strong humanitarian alignment; viable under existing free clinic models; enhanced deductions for food create meaningful tax efficiency; modular assets reduce costs.

**Risks**: FDA scrutiny on drug/OTC distribution (limited to compliant OTC); appraisal requirements for high-value DME; potential IRS challenge if donations deemed non-qualifying. Prescription generics deferred due to GMP complexity.

**Required Safeguards**: Annual independent appraisals; robust record-keeping; strict separation documentation; consultation with tax/FDA counsel.

**Overall Feasibility**: High (85–95%) with disciplined adherence to boundaries; grounded in current U.S. tax/FDA law as of December 2025.
