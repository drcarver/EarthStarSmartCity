# TerraWell FreeCare System: Executive Specification (December 2025)

## 1. Executive Summary

The **TerraWell FreeCare System**, operated by the independent **TerraWell Foundation** (a 501(c)(3) public charity), provides completely free urgent care, primary care, mental health services, and tangible medical goods to all individuals without means testing, co-pays, or identification requirements.

The system operates as a standalone humanitarian layer, legally and operationally separate from EarthStar Technologies' Genesis System. Facilities locate on Genesis brownfield sites using standard ceramic tile kits at arm's-length fair-market leases.

Scale goals: By 2050, deploy 500 fixed centers and 1,000 mobile units nationwide, serving 10–20 million patient-visits annually and distributing goods valued at $5–10 billion (FMV).

Net financial impact to EarthStar Technologies: Enhanced corporate tax deductions on qualifying donated inventory (primarily food under IRC §170(e)(3); limited for certain medical supplies), estimated $500M–$2B cumulative benefit through 2050, offset by FMV donation costs.

## 2. Legal & Tax Structure Description

The TerraWell Foundation operates as an independent 501(c)(3) public charity with its own board of directors (no overlap with EarthStar personnel).

It maintains separate facilities, finances, data systems, and operations. Funding derives exclusively from fair-market-value donations of tangible inventory from EarthStar Technologies and other sources; no public grants accepted to preserve flexibility.

Donations limit to tangible goods (food, OTC medications, select durable medical equipment like wheelchairs/crutches). EarthStar claims standard FMV deductions where applicable, with enhanced deductions for qualifying food inventory under IRC §170(e)(3)(C) (basis + 50% of appreciation, capped at 15% taxable income).

Medical supplies/equipment deductions are generally limited to basis unless qualifying under §170(e)(3) for care of the ill/needy. No deductions claimed for services, labor, or intangibles.

All care complies with state licensing; providers are paid or licensed volunteers employed directly by the Foundation.

## 5. Rollout Timeline 2027–2075

- **2027–2035**: Pilot phase → 10 fixed centers + 50 mobile units (Genesis revenue-funded).  
- **2036–2045**: Regional expansion → 100 fixed + 300 mobile.  
- **2046–2055**: National maturity → 300 fixed + 700 mobile.  
- **2056–2075**: Full scale → 500 fixed + 1,000 mobile; sustained operations.

Phasing ties to Genesis hub maturity and brownfield availability; realistic regulatory approvals assumed.

## 6. Mobile Unit Detailed Specifications and Disaster Response Protocols

Mobile units feature self-contained 35–40 ft vehicles with ceramic cladding, 2–3 exam rooms, basic lab, pharmacy dispensary, and smart airlocks with hyperspectral screening for triage/security.

They include solar-assisted power, AWG water recovery, and telepresence links for specialist consults.

Disaster protocols: Units deploy rapidly to affected areas under Foundation coordination (FEMA partnerships possible); prioritize triage, wound care, medication distribution; maintain 72-hour self-sufficiency.

## 7. Political & Reputational Risk Mitigation Analysis

Risks include scrutiny over corporate ties, perceived tax avoidance, or service quality.

Mitigations: Full transparency via annual IRS Form 990s; independent audits; strict arm's-length documentation; community advisory boards.

Reputational upside: Demonstrated humanitarian commitment enhances EarthStar brand without direct affiliation claims.

## 8. Strict Integration Rules with Genesis System / EarthStar Technologies

Prohibited: Shared personnel, data, branding, or facilities beyond leased space.

No co-location of operational areas; separate entrances/utilities.

Donations limited to tangible inventory at FMV; no services/labor.

All transactions documented as arm's-length; independent appraisals where required.

## 9. Honest Feasibility & Compliance Assessment

Strengths: Proven model aligns with community benefit standards; tangible goods donations provide clear tax efficiency; hyperspectral triage enhances safety/efficiency.

Risks: Limited enhanced deductions for non-food items; FDA scrutiny on donated devices/medications (must comply with labeling/distribution rules); staffing/recruitment challenges.

Safeguards: Robust compliance program; legal counsel oversight; phased rollout with pilots.

Overall: Highly feasible as structured; strong humanitarian impact with manageable risks.
