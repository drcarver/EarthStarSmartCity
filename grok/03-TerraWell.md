# TerraWell FreeCare System Executive Specification

## 1. Executive Summary

The **TerraWell FreeCare System**, operated by the independent **TerraWell Foundation** (a 501(c)(3) nonprofit), provides **100% free** primary, urgent, and mental health care, along with select tangible medical goods, to any individual in need—no means testing, co-pays, or identification required.

The Foundation maintains complete operational, governance, and financial separation from **EarthStar Technologies** and the **Genesis System**. Funding derives exclusively from arm's-length, fair-market-value donations of qualifying tangible inventory from EarthStar Technologies, enabling enhanced corporate tax deductions under IRC §170(e)(3) where applicable (primarily food inventory; limited for certain medical supplies).

**Scale Goals (2050):** 500 fixed centers and 1,000 mobile units co-located with Genesis hubs, serving millions annually and addressing gaps in underserved U.S. communities.

**Net Financial Impact to EarthStar Technologies:** Enhanced deductions on qualifying donated inventory (e.g., food ~basis + 50% appreciation, capped; DME potentially basis-only); indirect reputational benefits; no direct funding of services.

## 2. Legal & Tax Structure Description

The TerraWell Foundation operates as an independent 501(c)(3) public charity with a separate board of directors (no overlap with EarthStar personnel), bylaws, EIN, and bank accounts. It maintains strict firewalls: no shared data, personnel, facilities beyond co-location on Genesis sites, or intertwined operations.

All transactions occur at arm's-length with contemporaneous documentation. Donations are limited to tangible personal property (excess Genesis-produced food, select OTC medications if compliant, and durable medical equipment such as wheelchairs/crutches). No donation of services, cash equivalents, or professional time.

Corporate donor (EarthStar) claims deductions under IRC §170(e)(3) for qualified contributions used solely for care of the ill, needy, or infants, with written statements from the Foundation confirming use. Enhanced deduction applies primarily to food inventory; medical supplies/DME generally limited to basis (cost). Prescription drugs are not donated due to FDA restrictions.

The Foundation funds clinical operations through general charitable resources, volunteer providers where possible, and paid staff as needed—never tied to specific corporate donations.

## 5. Rollout Timeline 2027–2075

- **2027–2035:** Pilot phase – 10 fixed centers + 50 mobile units at early Genesis sites; establish compliance protocols.
- **2036–2050:** Scaling – 200 fixed + 500 mobile; integrate with maturing Genesis hubs.
- **2051–2075:** Maturity – Full 500/1,000 network; sustained operations and regional disaster support.

Phasing aligns with Genesis revenue availability for inventory donations.

## 6. Mobile Unit Detailed Specifications and Disaster Response Protocols

**Mobile Units:** Self-contained, DC-powered (Genesis grid-compatible) trailers/vehicles with exam rooms, basic pharmacy storage, hyperspectral entry screening, telehealth, and durable storage for donated goods. Staffed by licensed providers/volunteers.

**Disaster Protocols:** Pre-positioned units deploy within 48 hours to affected Genesis-adjacent areas; coordinate with FEMA/Red Cross for access; provide triage, basic care, food/DME distribution; maintain independence (no federal funds).

## 7. Political & Reputational Risk Mitigation Analysis

**Risks:** Perceived corporate influence; scrutiny over tax benefits; regulatory changes.

**Mitigations:** Transparent annual reporting (Form 990); independent audits; diverse board; strict firewalls; focus on humanitarian outcomes; no political activity.

Reputational upside: Demonstrated corporate social responsibility without private benefit.

## 8. Strict Integration Rules with Genesis System / EarthStar Technologies

**Explicit Prohibitions:**
- No shared governance, staff, or data systems.
- No co-branding or implied endorsement.
- No preferential access for Genesis residents/workers.
- Donations limited to excess tangible inventory at FMV; no directed giving.
- Separate physical entrances/spaces within co-located sites.
- No use of Genesis utilities/personnel for FreeCare operations.

All rules documented in bylaws and arm's-length agreements.

## 9. Honest Feasibility & Compliance Assessment

**Strengths:** Proven free clinic models (NAFC/VIM); strong humanitarian impact; viable tax-efficient inventory donation channel; modular Genesis infrastructure accelerates deployment.

**Risks:** FDA limits on drug donations (no prescriptions); deduction enhancements primarily for food; high operational costs for clinical staffing; potential IRS scrutiny of related-party transactions.

**Required Safeguards:** Independent legal counsel; annual compliance audits; detailed substantiation records; volunteer-heavy staffing model.

Overall: Highly feasible as a compliant, impactful safety-net provider complementing (but separate from) the Genesis ecosystem.
