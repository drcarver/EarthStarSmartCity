# TerraWell FreeCare System: Executive Specification

**TerraWell Foundation**  
December 2025  

The **TerraWell FreeCare System** is an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit operated by the TerraWell Foundation, dedicated to providing **100% free** primary, urgent, and mental health care, along with essential medical goods, to anyone in need—no means testing, co-pays, or identification required. Facilities are standalone structures built with standard ceramic tile kits on Genesis System brownfield sites, ensuring full legal and operational separation from EarthStar Technologies.

## 1. Executive Summary

**Mission**: Deliver unrestricted access to basic healthcare and durable medical goods for the ill, needy, and infants, advancing health equity and humanitarian relief in the United States.

**Scale Goals (2050 Targets)**:  
- 500 fixed FreeCare centers co-located with mature Genesis hubs.  
- 2,000 mobile units for rural/disaster response.  
- Serve 50–100 million annual patient encounters.  
- Distribute 10–20 million units of free medical goods yearly.

**Net Financial Impact to EarthStar Technologies**:  
Arm's-length donations of qualifying tangible inventory (primarily surplus food; selectively OTC medications and certain DME) enable enhanced deductions under IRC §170(e)(3) where applicable, potentially reducing effective tax liability by 20–35% on donated basis value. Standard FMV deductions apply to non-qualifying goods. No direct funding or services from EarthStar; all benefits derive from compliant charitable contributions.

## 2. Legal & Tax Structure Description

The TerraWell Foundation is a publicly supported 501(c)(3) organization with an independent board of directors unaffiliated with EarthStar Technologies. It maintains separate governance, finances, facilities, personnel, and data systems. Transactions with EarthStar occur solely at fair market value for tangible inventory donations, substantiated by independent appraisals where required (> $5,000 value).

Corporate donations qualify for deductions under IRC §170:  
- Enhanced under §170(e)(3) for apparently wholesome food and select inventory used solely for care of the ill/needy/infants (up to basis + 50% appreciation, capped at 2x basis; corporate limit 15% taxable income post-2015 enhancements).  
- Standard FMV (or basis) for OTC medications and durable medical equipment, subject to substantiation rules.  

No deduction for donated services, professional time, or intangibles. The Foundation accepts no public grants tied to corporate sources to preserve independence.

# TerraWell FreeCare System: Executive Specification Document

## 1. Executive Summary

The TerraWell FreeCare System, operated by the independent TerraWell Foundation as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, provides free humanitarian services including food distribution, over-the-counter (OTC) medications, generic drugs (where compliant), durable medical equipment (DME), and on-site medical care to underserved populations. Its mission is to alleviate hunger, illness, and mobility challenges through accessible, no-barrier aid, emphasizing care for the ill, needy, and infants in alignment with IRC §170(e)(3). Facilities are built using standard Genesis ceramic tiles and kits leased or purchased at arm's-length from EarthStar Technologies, ensuring no operational entanglement.

By 2050, the system aims to operate 500 fixed centers and 1,000 mobile units nationwide, serving 50 million individuals annually with an estimated 10 million tons of food, 100 million doses of medications, and 5 million DME items distributed. This scale supports EarthStar Technologies' enhanced tax deductions under §170(e)(3), potentially yielding $500–$1B in annual tax savings (based on donated inventory FMV of $2–$4B), while generating positive reputational benefits. Humanitarian impact includes reducing food insecurity by 5–10% in targeted areas and improving health access, all without accepting public funds to maintain independence.

## 2. Legal & Tax Structure Description

The TerraWell Foundation is a standalone 501(c)(3) public charity, organized and operated exclusively for charitable purposes under IRC §501(c)(3). It must serve public interests, prohibit private inurement, limit lobbying, and ban political campaigning. Exemption requires IRS Form 1023 approval, annual Form 990 filings, and state registrations.

Funding relies on fair-market-value (FMV) donations of tangible inventory from EarthStar Technologies, treated as arm's-length transactions. Under IRC §170(e)(3), EarthStar claims enhanced deductions for qualifying contributions (e.g., food inventory: cost basis + 50% of profit, capped at 2x cost) to charities aiding the ill, needy, or infants. Non-food items (e.g., certain medical supplies) may qualify partially if used for care of the ill. Deductions are limited to 10% of taxable income; no services or cash donations to avoid integration risks. The foundation maintains an independent board (no EarthStar overlap), separate finances, and audited statements to ensure compliance and avoid unrelated business income tax (UBIT).

## 3. Detailed Service Catalogue Table

All services and goods are provided 100% free, with no eligibility requirements. FMV based on 2025 benchmarks (e.g., wholesale prices); deduction eligibility per §170(e)(3).

| Category | Services/Goods | Description | Realistic FMV Range (2025) | Deduction Eligibility |
|----------|----------------|-------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| Food Distribution | Staples, proteins, produce | MyPlate-compliant meals from donated inventory; perishable and non-perishable. | $1.50–$2.00/lb ($3,000–$4,000/ton) | Enhanced (full for food to needy/ill/infants) |
| OTC Medications | Pain relievers (e.g., ibuprofen), antacids, allergy meds | Generic versions; unopened, non-expired. | $5–$15/bottle (100 doses) | Partial (if for care of ill) |
| Generic Drugs | Basic antibiotics, antihypertensives (FDA-compliant) | Donated only if not requiring prescription; compliant with FDA donation guidelines (proper labeling, no recalls). | $10–$50/course (30-day supply) | Partial (if qualifying medical supply for ill) |
| Durable Medical Equipment | Wheelchairs (manual), crutches, walkers, CPAP accessories | 3D-printed/customized; cleaned, functional condition. | Wheelchairs: $100–$500/unit; Crutches: $20–$50/pair; Walkers: $50–$100/unit; CPAP: $50–$200/accessory | Partial (if for care of ill/needy) |
| Medical Care | Urgent/primary care, mental health counseling | Provided by licensed staff/volunteers; basic triage via hyperspectral screening. | N/A (services not donated) | None (funded by operations) |

## 4. Physical Assets Table

Assets are purpose-built on brownfield sites, using Genesis tiles/kits purchased at FMV. Capex estimates in 2025 dollars, scaled to 2050 targets.

| Asset Type | Specifications | Quantity by 2050 | Capex per Unit ($M) | Total Capex ($B) |
|------------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Fixed Centers | 10,000 sq ft; clinics, distribution halls, smart airlocks for triage/security; solar-powered. | 500 | 5–10 | 2.5–5 |
| Mobile Units | Truck/trailer-based; equipped for food/DME distribution, pop-up clinics; hyperspectral scanners. | 1,000 | 0.5–1 | 0.5–1 |

## 5. Rollout Timeline 2027–2075

- **2027–2030 (Pilot Phase)**: Establish foundation, IRS approval; build 5 fixed centers, 20 mobile units. Initial donations/distributions in high-need areas.
- **2031–2040 (Expansion)**: Scale to 100 centers, 200 mobiles; integrate FDA-compliant drug donations; annual service to 10M individuals.
- **2041–2050 (National Maturity)**: Reach 500 centers, 1,000 mobiles; full integration of DME production; serve 50M annually.
- **2051–2075 (Sustain & Adapt)**: Maintain operations, upgrade tech (e.g., AI triage); potential international spin-offs; adapt to regulatory changes.

## 6. Mobile Unit Detailed Specifications and Disaster Response Protocols

Mobile units are 40-ft trailers with modular interiors: food storage (refrigerated), DME racks, mini-clinic (exam room, hyperspectral scanner for vital signs/pathogen detection). Powered by solar/battery, with secure airlocks for entry screening. Capacity: 1,000 meals/day, 100 DME items, 50 patients.

Disaster response protocols follow humanitarian best practices: (1) Pre-position units in vulnerable regions; (2) Activate upon federal/state declarations; (3) Coordinate with local authorities (e.g., FEMA) without funding ties; (4) Prioritize immediate aid (food, meds) via no-ID distribution; (5) Deploy medical staff for triage/care; (6) Post-event reporting to board for transparency. Emphasize cash-efficient operations, partnering with established relief orgs for logistics while maintaining independence.

## 7. Political & Reputational Risk Mitigation Analysis

Political risks include scrutiny over corporate-nonprofit ties (e.g., perceived tax avoidance) or lobbying perceptions. Mitigation: Strict firewalls, transparent 990 filings, no political activity to preserve 501(c)(3) status. Reputational risks from partnerships: Potential backlash if EarthStar faces controversies. Mitigation: Independent branding, public audits, focus on impact metrics (e.g., lives served). Additional safeguards: Diversify donors over time, crisis communication plans, ethical guidelines for staff.

## 8. Strict Integration Rules with Genesis System / EarthStar Technologies

- **Prohibitions**: No shared personnel, data, or facilities; no "visit credits" or tied services; no co-marketing; no EarthStar branding on FreeCare assets.
- **Allowed**: Arm's-length purchases/leases of Genesis tiles/kits at FMV; receipt of tangible donations only, documented with IRS appraisals.
- **Enforcement**: Annual compliance audits, separate IT systems, board oversight to prevent undue influence.

## 9. Honest Feasibility & Compliance Assessment

**Strengths**: Aligns with §170(e)(3) for tax-efficient philanthropy; high humanitarian impact via free access; scalable with Genesis infrastructure. FDA compliance feasible for OTC/DME if donations meet guidelines (unopened, non-expired).

**Risks**: Regulatory changes (e.g., tighter FDA donation rules); IRS scrutiny on enhanced deductions if not strictly for qualifying uses; operational challenges in disaster zones. Safeguards: Legal counsel reviews, conservative deduction claims, robust quality controls for donated goods.

Overall feasibility is high with proper separation, but requires ongoing vigilance to maintain tax-exempt status and avoid violations.
