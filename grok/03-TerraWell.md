# TerraWell FreeCare System: Detailed Specification

## Executive Summary

The TerraWell FreeCare System is a standalone 501(c)(3) nonprofit operated by the independent TerraWell Foundation, dedicated to providing 100% free healthcare services and essential goods to underserved populations across the U.S. Its mission is to deliver urgent, primary, and mental health care, along with donated tangible goods such as food, OTC medications, generic drugs (where FDA-compliant), and durable medical equipment (DME) like wheelchairs, crutches, walkers, and CPAP accessories, without any co-pays, means testing, or ID requirements.

By 2050, the system aims to scale to 1,000 fixed centers and 2,000 mobile units, serving over 10 million patients annually, based on current U.S. free clinic projections (1,400 clinics serving ~6 million in 2024, with growth amid rising uninsured rates to 16 million by 2025 per CBO). This expansion aligns with humanitarian needs amid Medicaid cuts and political volatility.

Net financial impact to EarthStar Technologies: Enhanced tax deductions under IRC §170(e)(3) for donated inventory (cost + half profit, max 2x cost) could yield $5–15B in tax savings by 2035 (assuming 10–20% of $150–400B revenues donated as qualifying goods at 21% corporate tax rate), boosting effective net revenues by 5–10%. This supports viability without compromising the legal firewall.

## Legal & Tax Structure Description

TerraWell FreeCare operates as a separate 501(c)(3) public charity under IRC §501(c)(3), meeting organizational and operational tests: organized exclusively for charitable purposes (relief of the poor/distressed/ill) with no private inurement, and operated accordingly per Revenue Ruling 69-545 for charitable hospitals/clinics. It maintains an independent board (no EarthStar overlap), separate facilities on Genesis brownfields (leased at FMV), and arm's-length transactions.

Tax benefits: EarthStar donates tangible inventory only (no services/professional time), qualifying for enhanced deductions under §170(e)(3) for goods used for care of the ill/needy (e.g., food up to 15% of AGI; medical supplies partial). Standard deductions apply otherwise. No public funds accepted to avoid political risks. Compliance ensured via annual Form 990 filings, audited financials, and IRS oversight. FDA compliance for drugs: Donations limited to approved, unexpired generics/OTC per 21 CFR 203.39; no controlled substances.

Viability enhancement: Structure minimizes risks from corporate ties, with explicit prohibitions (see Section 8).

## Detailed Service Catalogue Table

All services/goods are 100% free; FMV based on 2025 benchmarks (e.g., generics $15–50/30-day supply; OTC $5–20/item; food $2–5/meal equivalent; DME $100–1,000/unit). Deduction eligibility per §170(e)(3).

## Physical Assets Table

Assets built with Genesis kits/tiles (purchased at FMV); capex estimates from 2025 data (clinics $1–5M; mobiles $200–300K).

| Asset Type | Specs | Quantity by 2050 | Capex per Unit (2025) | Total Capex by 2050 |
|------------|-------|-------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Fixed Centers | 5,000–10,000 sq ft; airlocks with hyperspectral triage; exam rooms, pharmacy. | 1,000 | $1–5M | $1–5B |
| Mobile Units | Vans/trailers; equipped for on-site care; biogas-powered. | 2,000 | $200–300K | $0.4–0.6B |

## Rollout Timeline 2027–2075

Phased, tied to Genesis revenues (self-funding 2029+); recalculated for integration (delayed national scale to 2040+ for compliance).

- **2027–2030**: Pilot 10 centers/20 mobiles; capex $50–100M; serve 100K patients.
- **2031–2040**: Scale to 200 centers/400 mobiles; capex $500M–1B; 2M patients/yr.
- **2041–2050**: Reach 1,000 centers/2,000 mobiles; capex $1–5B total; 10M patients/yr.
- **2051–2075**: Maintain/expand as needed; focus on sustainability; projected 20M patients/yr by 2075 amid rising needs.

## Mobile Unit Detailed Specifications and Disaster Response Protocols

Specs: 20–40 ft vans/trailers; biogas turbines; hyperspectral airlocks for triage/security; equipped with DME, drugs, basic diagnostics (cost $200–300K/unit). Protocols: Deploy within 24–48 hrs to disasters; coordinate with FEMA/red cross (no public funds); prioritize triage/distribution; FDA-compliant drug handling; annual drills.

## Political & Reputational Risk Mitigation Analysis

Risks: Scrutiny of corporate ties (e.g., perceived influence; 2025 politicization trends); funding volatility from policy shifts (Medicaid cuts adding 7.8M uninsured). Mitigation: Strict firewall; transparent 990s; diverse board; no advocacy; compliance audits; focus on neutral humanitarian aid to avoid DEI/political backlash.

## Strict Integration Rules with Genesis System / EarthStar Technologies

- No data/personnel sharing; independent ops.
- Facilities leased at FMV; no free services/goods beyond donations.
- Explicit prohibitions: No tied donations (goods only, arm's-length); no EarthStar branding; no joint events; separate IT/finances.

## Honest Feasibility & Compliance Assessment

Strengths: Humanitarian impact; tax efficiency for EarthStar (5–10% revenue boost); scalable amid needs (6M served 2024). Risks: FDA limits on drugs; ops funding (rely on other donors/sales?); political scrutiny (mitigated by firewall). Safeguards: Annual audits; legal counsel; diversified funding. Overall viability high (8/10) with separation; enhances project by adding social good/tax savings.
