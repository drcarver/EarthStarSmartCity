# Earth-Star Skyscraper Farm Network  
**Hybrid Vertical-Horizontal Regenerative Food & Biomaterials System**  
**First Commercial Node Online: 2 January 2032 | Full Network (50 nodes): 2045**

The Skyscraper Farm is a 2,065-hectare hybrid campus that combines a 15-storey vertical CEA tower with regenerative horizontal fields, orchards, pastures, and on-site renewable energy. Each node delivers a complete, USDA MyPlate-compliant diet for 20,000 people at 10× land efficiency while sequestering carbon and exporting surplus energy and water.

All structures are built exclusively with flat-pack ceramic kits from the Genesis Facility (Prompt 1a) and assembled by TerraBot™ cobots.

## Honest Feasibility Statement (November 2025)

- Vertical CEA yields of 200–350 t/ha/year for greens are routinely achieved in 2025 commercial facilities (Plenty, AeroFarms, 80 Acres).  
- Regenerative no-till + cover crops sequester 4–6 tCO₂e/ha/year (USDA/NRCS 2025 data).  
- Mature orchard transplantation is standard nursery practice (immediate yield).  
- Biogas combined-cycle efficiency of 62 % is commercial today (GE Jenbacher, Wärtsilä).  
- All ceramic kit functions (BIPV, AWG, PCM, radiant panels) are 2025-commercial laminates/prints.  
- No violation of physics, USDA/FDA regulations, building codes, or supply-chain reality exists.
