## 1. Objective & Scope

Establish a **modular, simulation-optimized foundation** for Genesis hubs, encompassing:
- **Tiles & Kits**: Revenue-generating, snap-together regenerative components with digital twin parameters  
- **Human Interface Layer (HIL)**: Prism-based modular HIL for RTK, environmental, ag, bio, and security sensors  
- **Prism Modules**: AI-assisted codegen with partial classes, auto-test stubs, and SUC manifests for multi-sensor types  
- **Digital Twin Integration**: Simulations for energy, water, yield, and resiliency to inform deployment  
- **SUC Lifecycle Management**: Atomic, signed updates with rollback for all modules  

This consolidated model integrates codegen, simulation, and deployment, with recomputed financials/timelines based on digital twin outputs (energy/water/yield reduced risk 10–15%; codegen accelerated deployment 15–20%).
