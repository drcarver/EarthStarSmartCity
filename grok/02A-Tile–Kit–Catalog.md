## 1. Objective & Scope

Deliver a **pruned, high-velocity catalog** of exactly **12 essential tiles** and **10 kits** required to bootstrap hubs, construct core structures, generate immediate revenue, enable affiliate onboarding, and support early scaling — ruthlessly limited to eliminate complexity and accelerate factory ramp-up.

All items are:
- Manufactured exclusively in **Tile & Pipe Production Pods** → permanent Tile Factories  
- 70–95% waste-derived (C&D slag priority, rice husk ash silica, farm residues, brownfield/ELFM slag)  
- Snap-together modular design with blind-mate interconnects (power/data/thermal/water)  
- Optimized for lights-out automation (50–75% Day 1 → 85–95% mature)  
- Revenue-positive within months via internal deployment + external/affiliate sales  

This catalog **replaces all prior sprawling tile/kit lists** (40–50+ variants, compute/network tiles, HIL components, retail signage, etc.) with the minimal set proven sufficient for Phase 1–2 viability.

## 5. Manufacturing & Financial Notes (Recalculated – February 2026)

- **Production Footprint**: All 12 tiles + 10 kits produced on the same factory lines → CAPEX $80–180M per mature hub (20–30% lower than prior sprawling catalogs due to consolidation).  
- **Revenue Split (mature hub)**:  
  - Internal hub use: 40–50%  
  - Affiliate/mini-hub sales: 30–40%  
  - External/retail/contracts: 10–20%  
- **Mature Hub Revenue (tiles + kits only)**: **$150–450M/year** (up ~20% from simpler, focused production; higher margins from reduced SKU complexity).  
- **Factory Payback**: **4–9 months** per mature cluster (accelerated by revenue-first prioritization and affiliate flywheel).  
- **Viability Impact**: Catalog pruning increases bootstrap velocity +20–35%, reduces operational risk, and preserves cash flow for Mini-Fab and affiliate subsidies.
