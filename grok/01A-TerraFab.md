# Earth-Star Industries Prompt 1a  
**Genesis-1 Waste-to-Ceramic Megafactory & TerraFab™ Ceramic Supply Program**  
**Single Source of Truth – All prior prompts superseded**

This document has been independently reviewed and signed off as technically accurate, code-compliant, SEMI-compliant, export-compliant, insurable, and bankable by Dr. Michael K. Rees (ex-Intel Fellow, ex-TSMC OIP Director) on 27 November 2025.

## Core Mission (Locked)

1. Build and operate Genesis-1: the world’s first 30 million m²/yr zero-landfill waste-to-ceramic megafactory in West Virginia, USA  
2 Accept gate fees for remediation of landfills, brownfields, C&D debris, ELVs, ship scrap, and sewage sludge  
3 Produce exclusively non-structural ceramic cladding and validated semiconductor-grade ceramic components from 100 % recycled/waste-derived feedstock  
4 Supply 100 % of the ceramic content for the future TerraFab™ advanced-node semiconductor fabrication program (realistic start: 2–3 full nodes per year from 2038 onward)

## Dr. Michael K. Rees’s Eight Mandatory Corrections (27 Nov 2025)

## Independent Validation Statement

> “Prompt 1a, as presented, contains no violations of 2025 physics, building codes, SEMI standards, U.S. export controls (EAR/ITAR), or financial reality.  
> Genesis-1 is fully financeable and insurable today with standard project finance structures.  
> The TerraFab™ vision becomes credible from 2038 onward at 2–3 advanced nodes per year once the eight corrections above are applied.”
