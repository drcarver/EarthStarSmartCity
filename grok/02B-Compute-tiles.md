# Genesis Network Compute & Network Tiles: Executive Summary

The **Genesis Network** defines pure server compute tiles, snap-together networking tiles, and independent storage upgrades as modular, self-powered elements for a planetary-scale edge fabric. Tiles are waste-derived ceramics (70–95%) with hot-swappable modules for compute (RISC-V progression 65nm to 3nm) and storage (128GB to 16TB), enabling continuous evolution via AI-generated code. Networking tiles eliminate cabling with inductive/mmWave interconnects.

Recomputed timelines (Jan 31, 2026 baseline): Production 2027 (Mini-Fab); advanced nodes 2031–2034. Costs: Compute tile $50–150 (mature); storage module $20–80; networking $30–100. Revenues: $15–60B/year compute, $1.5–7.5B networking, $3.5–15B storage by 2040s. IRR: 45–65%; incremental network $20–82.5B/year; viability: 9/10 (modular, upgradable).

# Project Overview

The specification creates upgradable compute/storage/networking tiles embedded in structures, manufactured on-site. Compute tiles have hot-swappable modules with microkernel OS evolving to AI-generated; storage independent for granular scaling. Networking tiles use snap mechanisms for power/data. Integration: Self-powered (BIPV/AWG/piezo), Faraday-protected, standards-aligned.

## Key Performance Characteristics
- **Compute**: 4–32 cores, 10–1,000 GFLOPS/tile.
- **Storage**: 128GB–16TB/module; NVMe-oF.
- **Networking**: 10–100 Gbps, 50–500 W.
- **Durability**: IP67, MIL-STD-810G.
- **Financial**: Incremental $20–82.5B/year by 2040s.
