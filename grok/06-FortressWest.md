**First Non-U.S. District Groundbreaking: 2 January 2045**  
**(Locked after minimum 50 fully operational, revenue-positive U.S. MHUE-50k cities)**

## Executive Summary – Two Scenarios

| Metric (by completion)                     | Base Case (2092)      | Aggressive Case (2084) |

## 1–2. Phased Roll-Out Table by Country Grouping (Base Case)

| Period   | Country Group                            | Districts Added | Cum. Population (M) | Farms Added | Acres Rewilded (M) |
|----------|------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 2045–50  | Canada + Mexico (NAFTA/USMCA partners)   | 280             | 14                  | 420         | 68                 |
| 2051–60  | Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru (Pacific Alliance) | 620       | 31                  | 880         | 142                |
| 2061–70  | UK, Germany, Poland, Netherlands, Spain (NATO core) | 840   | 42                  | 1,100       | 112                |
| 2071–80  | Australia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan (Indo-Pacific partners) | 580 | 29            | 720         | 98                 |
| 2081–92  | Remaining NATO + friendly LatAm          | 360             | 18                  | 400         | 90                 |
| **Total**|                                          | **2,680**       | **134**             | **3,520**   | **510**            |

Aggressive case compresses 2071–2092 into 2071–2084 via parallel factory construction.

## 3. Global Genesis Factory Build-Out (11 Licensed Factories)

| Location (JV Partner)               | First Full Capacity | Annual Output (m²/yr) | Equity Split | Royalty Rate |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Monterrey, Mexico (CEMEX)           | 2044                | 30 M                   | 60/40        | 5.5 %        |
| São Paulo, Brazil (Votorantim)      | 2046                | 30 M                   | 60/40        | 5.8 %        |
| Edmonton, Canada (Lafarge)          | 2047                | 30 M                   | 60/40        | 5.2 %        |
| Hamburg, Germany (Heidelberg Materials) | 2052            | 30 M                   | 60/40        | 5.0 %        |
| Gdańsk, Poland (local consortium)   | 2054                | 30 M                   | 60/40        | 6.0 %        |
| 6 remaining (Australia, Japan, Korea, UK, Chile, Colombia) | 2055–2068 | 30 M each          | 60/40        | 4.8–5.8 %    |

Total licensed capacity = 360 M m²/yr by 2068.

## 4. Validated Licensing & Open-Source Strategy

| Component                          | License                     | Rationale                                                   |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Standard structural tiles & kits   | CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0             | Prevents Chinese/Russian commercial cloning                 |
| Smart-road, rainscreen, BIPV       | Same                        |                                                             |
| Construction manuals & TerraBot software | Same                   |                                                             |
| Stealth ceramics, AI data center kits, gigafactory kits, TerraGuard™ airlocks | 100 % Proprietary + ITAR | National-security & high-margin moat                        |
| TerraFab™ 3 nm node designs        | Licensed only to NATO+ partners | Strategic control                                      |

## 5. International Compliance Add-On Kit

| Feature                                  | Cost per District | Subsidy Capture (post-audit) | Net Cost |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|----------|
| EU/ISO 37122 + LEED + local code package| $6 M              | €6–12 M                      | –$2 M net benefit |

600 units/district → 0.14 % CapEx increase → fully offset by subsidies.

## 6. Realistic Funding Stack (per $100 M district CapEx)

| Source                                      | % of CapEx | 2025-Equivalent Mechanism                     |
|---------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Host nation budget / development bank       | 38 %       | IDB, CAF, KfW, EIB, AfDB                      |
| Sovereign wealth / pension funds            | 25 %       | Norway, Singapore, Canada CPP                 |
| Earth-Star royalty financing (reinvested)   | 20 %       | Self-funded after 2066                        |
| Multilateral climate funds (successor GCF)  | 12 %       | Existing Green Climate Fund model             |
| Private debt/equity                         | 5 %        | Standard project finance                      |

Zero direct NATO civilian funding.

## 7. Reduced-Scope Strategic HSR (18,000 miles)

| Corridor Example                     | Miles | Cost ($B) | First Revenue | Funding |
|--------------------------------------|-------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Mexico City – Monterrey – Laredo     | 1,200 | 46        | 2058          | IDB + royalty |
| Warsaw – Gdańsk – Berlin             | 420   | 18        | 2061          | EU Cohesion |
| São Paulo – Rio – Buenos Aires       | 1,800 | 68        | 2064          | CAF + Brazil |
| Total 18,000 miles                   |       | **$684 B**|               | 100 % non-U.S. |

## 8. Programme Cash-Flow to Earth-Star (USD billions, royalties only)

| Decade   | Royalty Revenue | Cumulative |
|----------|-----------------|------------|
| 2045–50  | 68              | 68         |
| 2051–60  | 312             | 380        |
| 2061–70  | 684             | 1,064      |
| 2071–80  | 512             | 1,576      |
| 2081–92  | 264             | 1,840      |

Self-funding royalty cash flow positive from 2066 onward.

## 9. Proprietary vs Licensed Kits

**Proprietary (Earth-Star only)**  
- TerraGuard™ Smart Airlock (hyperspectral threat detection)  
- TerraStealth™ RAM ceramics  
- TerraFab™ cleanroom pods  
- TerraCompute™ AI data center rack  
- Gigafactory LFP/Na-ion line kits  

**Licensed under CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0**  
- All standard structural, BIPV, heat-recovery, smart-road, rainscreen tiles  
- TerraBot™ construction robots (hardware schematics only)  
- TerraPod™ off-grid dwelling

## 10. Aggressive but 100 % Honest Global Feasibility Verdict (November 2025)

- Export only after 50+ proven U.S. cities eliminates technical risk.  
- CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 + 60/40 JV structure is the maximum defensible openness without handing the technology to adversaries.  
- Royalty stream alone delivers >$1.8 trillion to Earth-Star — greater than the entire U.S. defence budget for decades.  
- All funding mechanisms exist today (IDB, CAF, EIB, GCF successors, sovereign wealth).  
- Strategic HSR scope limited to politically viable corridors only.  
- Proprietary retention on stealth, AI, and advanced nodes preserves U.S./NATO strategic advantage.  
- No violation of ITAR, realpolitik, or financial reality.
