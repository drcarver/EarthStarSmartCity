## 1. Objective & Strategic Value

**Smart Display Walls** transform building façades, community plazas, retail fronts, tower exteriors, TerraWell centers, public spaces, and internal surfaces into dynamic, revenue-generating, community-serving infrastructure using **snap-together Smart Furniture Surface Tiles** (indoor) and hardened outdoor variants.

**Core Goals**:
- High-resolution, sunlight-readable, multi-user interactive digital displays  
- Free, secure public WiFi hotspots with isolated guest networking  
- Hot-swappable embedded compute/storage for local AI inference, edge services, federated learning  
- Near-zero grid dependency via BIPV solar + piezoelectric harvesting + AWG condensate cooling  
- Full compatibility with Genesis closed-loop ecosystem, dense sensor nets, digital twins, smart city standards  

**Primary Use Cases**:
- Retail façades → dynamic showcases, interactive queries, shopper WiFi  
- Community plazas → civic info, events, free broadband  
- TerraWell centers → offline health education, telehealth queries, free WiFi + theater/food service  
- Tower buildings → full-height media skins + edge compute clusters  
- Public spaces → wayfinding, emergency alerts, tourism info

## 6. Viability & Strategic Summary

**Overall Rating**: **9.2/10**  
Smart display walls convert passive surfaces into active, revenue-generating assets while preserving modularity, self-powering (BIPV/piezo/AWG), and closed-loop principles. High-margin revenue (ads/broadband/edge compute) + community value (free WiFi/education) create strong goodwill and monetization flywheel. Deployment on private Network/affiliate land minimizes regulatory burden.
