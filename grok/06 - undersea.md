# Part 6: Earth-Star Industries Under sea cities

Under sea cities could also be used to help restore overfished by providing fingerlings for release.  We could also use these to restore habitats along all the shorelines of the United States by growing coral and stuff that's required for that rehabilitation or remediation anyway.  In addition to providing housing for residents these undersea domes can become big tourist hubs and centers for marine biology and studies of the ocean in general.  If the domes can be made fairly transparent then they become almost reverse aquariums for the people on the inside are looking at the sea life on the outside.  The undersea domes were already performing as tourist attractions but this allows us to have transparent domes placed in very interesting ecological areas around the US to be able to see different types of marine life and ecosystems in those areas
