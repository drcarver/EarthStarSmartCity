## 1. Doctrine Overview & Purpose

This consolidated doctrine defines the **ultra-rapid hub self-expansion model** leveraging **AI-assisted Prism module generation**, **digital twin simulations**, **SUC lifecycle updates**, and **resource modeling**. It serves as the operational blueprint for hub replication, module creation, and automated financial/timeline recalculations.

**Key Updates (v3)**:  
- Digital twin simulations for tiles/pods/sensors (energy/water/yield/resiliency estimates)  
- AI-assisted Prism module codegen (partial classes for manual/generated separation)  
- Auto-test stubs + SUC manifest creation for all modules  
- Parallelized OS/Prism host deployment (VMs + hardware emulation)  
- Integration with resource-driven revenue/CAPEX/OPEX modeling
