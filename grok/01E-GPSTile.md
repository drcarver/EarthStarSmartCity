# Genesis Network RTK-Enabled GPS Tile: Executive Summary

The **Genesis Network RTK-Enabled GPS Tile** is a modular, snap-in ceramic tile providing 1–3 cm positioning accuracy for precision agriculture, robotics, tracking, and digital twins. Integrated into roofs/walls/floors/roads/pods, it uses multi-constellation RTK GNSS (u-blox ZED-F9P equivalent) with embedded antenna, RISC-V compute, and tile fabric networking. Production leverages waste-derived ceramics and Mini-Fabs for low-cost, high-volume output.

Retail sales recommended: Premium standalone product ($250–$600) targeting farmers, surveyors, robotics, government, consumers—driving ecosystem adoption and margins. Recomputed timelines advance prototype to 2027 (aligning with network bootstrap); initial production 2028. Costs: Mature $50–100/unit (adjusted from 2026 module prices ~$100-200, antenna $5-15, assembly efficiencies); retail revenue $120–720M/year by 2035–2040.

Financial impact: Hub cost +$1.5–5.5M; revenue uplift $2–8M/hub/year (internal + sales). IRR: 50–70%; network incremental $5–20B/year by 2050; viability: 9/10 (high-leverage, flexible deployment).

# Project Overview

The RTK GPS Tile enhances the Genesis Network with centimeter-level positioning, snapping into any tile location via blind-mate interconnects. It supports base/rover modes, broadcasting RTCM corrections over the tile fabric for hub-wide precision. Manufactured in-house from waste ceramics, it integrates GNSS engine, antenna, and micro-compute. Retail model introduces externals to Genesis, with bundles (tile + badge + subscription) creating upsell flywheel.

Deployment: Flexible placement where needed; privacy-focused local processing. Off-world potential for Mars/Lunar surveying.

## Key Performance Characteristics
- **Accuracy**: 1–3 cm RTK; 5–20 cm PPP fallback.
- **Power**: 15–60 mW active; BIPV/piezo self-sustaining.
- **Durability**: IP67, MIL-STD-810G.
- **Networking**: <1s latency; encrypted.
- **Financial**: Mature cost $50–100; retail $250–600.

# Core Principles
- Modular Snap-In: Seamless integration into tile family.
- Waste-Derived: 65%+ slag/RHA for ceramics.
- Dual-Mode: Auto base/rover.
- Local-First: Privacy via on-tile processing.
- Retail Flywheel: High-margin entry to ecosystem.
- Scalable Production: Mini-Fabs for volume.
