# Earth-Star Industries Skyscraper Farm

The Earth-Star Industries Skyscraper Farm is a 15-floor, large-scale agricultural facility (5-acre footprint, ~300,000 m²) designed to produce organic farm-derived products (seafood, crops, meat, eggs, milk, processed goods) to feed a 20,000-person urban district. Built entirely using Enhanced Ceramic Tiles and Smart Studs from the Earth-Star Industries Facility, it connects via smart roads and sidewalks, supplying feedstock for ceramics and semiconductors. The farm adheres to USDA Organic, ASC, GAP Step 4, halal (IFANCA), kosher (OU), and BPI standards, prioritizing livestock welfare and cultural/religious diversity (halal, kosher, vegan). It integrates 90–95% water recycling, comprehensive waste processing, and renewable energy, financed by tile factory revenues and grants, and operates off-grid by recycling existing infrastructure. All equipment, including cleanroom, ceramics production, and recycling lines, is constructed from ceramic tiles and modular kits sourced from the tile factory. Smart airlocks at all entrances (10 tiles each) provide facial recognition, role-based access, and scanning for weapons/explosives with instant security alerts, compliant with ISO 37122 smart city standards. All structures minimize light pollution via low-glare ceramic finishes and shielded LEDs, supporting sustainable building codes (LEED Gold, ASHRAE 90.1).
